# Attachments

Owner: [dim-agent-attachments](../../../../crates/dim-agent-attachments/src/lib.rs).
Registers the `attachment` namespace with `sessionMethods`: `attachment.put` stores a large paste
as a Session file through SessionStore's `sessionFiles` and returns its path.
The model reads that path with `read` like any file. Design:
[Attachments](../../../design/plugins/Attachments.md).

## Dependencies

| Service | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `S:SessionIdentity` | The Session a put stores for; Rpc already resolved it from `sessionId`. |
| `P:SessionFilesHost` | SessionStore's `sessionFiles.put`. In this graph it is a graph-only fixture that stores nothing. |
| `S:SessionMethods` | Register the `attachment` namespace from `apply`, until this part unloads. |

## Method

`attachment.put {sessionId, name?, text | pdfBase64}` (mutating, `drain`, no progress)
replies `{attachmentId, path, bytes}`, SessionStore's reply passed through with
`attachmentId = fileId`. `name` defaults to `paste.txt`.

```text
params ──> wrong shape? ───────────────> invalid_params (-32602)
   │       text empty? ────────────────> attachment_invalid
   │       text over 10 MiB? ──────────> attachment_too_large
   v
sessionFiles.put(own Session, name, UTF-8 bytes, call token)
   ├─ stored ─────────────────────────> {attachmentId, path, bytes}
   ├─ not_found ──────────────────────> session_closed
   ├─ invalid ────────────────────────> attachment_invalid
   ├─ too_large ──────────────────────> attachment_too_large
   ├─ node_unavailable ───────────────> node_unavailable
   ├─ cancelled ──────────────────────> service_reloading
   └─ storage ────────────────────────> storage_failed
```

Every code except `invalid_params` is `-32000`. SessionStore owns the name
rule and its 16 MiB cap; Attachments checks only its content rules.

## Events and lifetime

No Timeline events and no state. `drain`: an unload of the provider or of the
Rpc load that admitted a call fires the call's token, which SessionStore checks
right before its commit; the reply is then the path if the file committed,
otherwise `service_reloading` with nothing stored. A client disconnect cancels
nothing. Attachments reloads with SessionStore, its only process dependency,
which Agents already depend on.

## Installation

`serve` installs it next to Mcp's Session part when the host has native
storage and local execution (`native_home`); elsewhere `attachment.put` is
`unknown_method`. This graph installs it the same way.

## Tests

[attachments_flow.rs](../../../../crates/dim-app-server/tests/attachments_flow.rs)
covers `attachment.put` through Rpc (the reply, the model reading the file
with `read` without approval, rejections, a storage failure, a closed Session
and `unknown_method`), and an unload, a Session record gone before the commit
and an inactive node at the `sessionMethods` contract.
