# CLI feature list

This list describes target capabilities and interfaces for `dimcode`, not implementation status. The npm launcher also exposes the `dim` alias.

The CLI owns terminal and command interactions; the App Server owns host configuration, external protocols and persisted Sessions; Agent v4 Capabilities own branch execution. The [architecture](architecture/README.md) and [foundation ADR](adr/001-harness-foundation.md) define the existing contracts. Provider-specific account behavior belongs to separately maintained plugins under the [managed provider boundary](architecture/development.md#managed-provider-boundary).

## Providers and models

- OAuth Providers: sign in, sign out and refresh account state.
- API-key Providers: configure API keys, service URLs and models.
- Provider management: add, edit, test, enable, disable, remove and switch Providers.
- `/connect`: connect and manage Providers; alias `/provider`. The Dim account is not listed here.
- `/login`: sign in to the Dim account (managed provider) by browser, enterprise email or device code; `/logout` signs it out.
- `/models`: view and switch models, and adjust supported reasoning effort.
- `/effort`: adjust the current model's reasoning effort; alias `/reasoning`. Fullscreen TUI has a separate entry; scrollback adjusts effort through `/models`.
- `/fast`: toggle fast mode when supported by the current model.
- Subagent models: inherit the main session's model, use a fixed model or let the Agent choose.
- Auxiliary models: configure models for auxiliary tasks.

## Session management

- `/new`: start over on an empty screen; the first message creates the Session.
- `/resume`: view and resume historical Sessions; alias `/sessions`.
- `/export`: export conversation history as Markdown or JSON.
- `/timeline`: list the shown line's user messages, jump to one, and edit, quote, branch or fork from it.
- Session list: view Sessions for the current project or all projects.
- Session titles: generate titles automatically; support manual renaming through the scrollback panel and CLI commands.
- Session forks: create a new Session from a historical message.
- File rollback: roll back file changes recorded by the Session; fullscreen TUI only.
- File and conversation rollback: rewind files and the conversation to a historical point together; fullscreen TUI only.
- Session deletion and cleanup: delete Sessions through CLI commands; clean up by age or retained count, with a preview.
- Request snapshot export: export model request context through CLI commands, with filters for reasoning, tool records and compressed content.

## In-session interaction

### Sending, queuing and steering

- Send: press Enter while idle to submit input and start the Agent; combine text, file references and images in one message.
- Queue: press Enter during an Agent run to queue the draft without interrupting the current task.
- Automatic sending: after the current run ends, send queued messages in submission order to start subsequent runs.
- Steer: press Ctrl+S during an Agent run to add the draft to the current run's context at a subsequent Agent turn boundary, without stopping the task first. With an empty draft, Ctrl+S or Enter steers the oldest queued message; an empty queue has no effect.
- `/queue`: view messages awaiting submission and messages being incorporated into the current run; select an entry to steer or delete it.
- Retrieve for editing: with an empty draft, press Shift+Left to move the newest queued message back into the input area. Messages with attachments or file references cannot be retrieved this way; use `/queue` to manage them.
- Queue deletion: remove messages that have not been sent; a steering instruction already handed to the current run cannot be deleted as a queued message.
- Interrupt: press Esc to stop the current Agent run; queued messages return to the input area instead of running; an open dialog or input suggestion takes priority.
- Clear draft and exit: while idle, clear the draft or exit the terminal. During a run, the first `Ctrl+C` interrupts in scrollback; fullscreen TUI clears the draft or enters the exit flow according to the input state.

`send`, `queue` and `steer` name submission behaviors. There are no `/send` or `/steer` commands.

### Input, references and attachments

- Multiline editing: use `Shift+Enter` or `Ctrl+J` for a newline; `Shift+Enter` requires terminal support.
- Input history: use Up/Down to retrieve submitted prompts and `!` / `!!` command history, stored per working directory; availability depends on cursor position and draft state.
- Command completion: use `/` to find commands and Skills; execute a selected command or complete it before entering arguments.
- Skill references: choose a Skill through the `/` command palette, or type `$skill: <name>`; the reference loads that Skill with the message it is submitted with. Inserting a reference does not send the message. `/` is the only trigger, and `@` remains the file picker.
- File references: use `@` to search project paths, browse directories and select files; ordinary files are passed as paths for the Agent to read as needed.
- Pasted and dropped paths: recognize existing paths, including multiple paths, quoted paths and `file://` URLs. Ordinary files become path references; supported images become attachments. Drag-and-drop depends on the terminal passing paths.
- Multiline paste: display long or multiline text as a compact block and restore the full text on submission.
- Large paste: turn very large text into a text attachment; save the full text on submission and provide a reference instead of inserting it directly into the prompt body.
- Image insertion: attach clipboard images, image paths or images selected through `@`. Accept PNG, JPEG, WebP and GIF; image understanding requires model support.
- Mixed attachments: combine multiple images, text attachments, file references and explanatory text in one message.
- Remove references and attachments: deleting an input marker excludes it from submission. Removing an image attachment cleans up terminal-created temporary cache files without deleting the user's original file.
- `!command`: execute Shell commands in the Session and include their output in subsequent model context.
- `!!command`: execute Shell commands without adding their output to model context; retain the terminal record.

### Clipboard and message viewing

- Text paste: use the terminal's paste shortcut to insert at the cursor; recognize ordinary text, multiline text, large text and file paths.
- Clipboard images: use `Ctrl+V` to read screenshots or images from the system clipboard and insert attachments.
- Clipboard files: use `Ctrl+V` to read files copied in a file manager; images become attachments and other files become path references, including multiple files.
- Message copying: copy message text to the clipboard through message actions.
- Selection copying: fullscreen TUI supports mouse selection and copies selected text on release; scrollback uses the terminal's native selection and copying.
- Clipboard compatibility: copy text through the system clipboard and OSC 52 for local and SSH use. Over SSH, terminals with the kitty clipboard protocol (OSC 5522, e.g. kitty, Ghostty 1.4+) also serve `Ctrl+V` image (PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF) and text reads from the local clipboard; other terminals keep the native readers. Image/file reads and remote copying depend on platform components and terminal support.
- History browsing and navigation: use `/timeline` to locate messages. Fullscreen TUI loads earlier records from a row at the top of the transcript; in scrollback a `/timeline` jump to an earlier message draws history from it, and the terminal's own scrollback does the rest.
- Open links: click web and local-file links in fullscreen TUI output to open them with the system's default browser or application.
- Tool groups: each group of tool calls is collapsed by default (`▸`); click its header in fullscreen TUI to cycle that group through collapsed, one-row-per-call summary, and expanded forms. `/tools` cycles every group through the same forms; compaction bodies show only in expanded. See [transcript detail settings](design/cli-commands.md#transcript-detail-settings).

### Run feedback and confirmation

- Streaming output: display Agent replies, model-provided reasoning previews and tool results as they arrive. Reasoning has a single-line preview without a separate full-text expansion entry.
- Run status: show the current task, tool status and errors; scrollback also shows elapsed run and tool-wait time.
- Terminal status: tell the terminal whether dim is idle, working, waiting on a permission or a question, done or failed (OSC 7501), in both terminal UI modes, so tabs and inboxes can show it; `DIM_TERMINAL_STATUS=off` turns it off.
- Terminal progress bar: an indeterminate bar while a run works and a paused one while it waits on a permission or a question (OSC 9;4), in both terminal UI modes, on Windows Terminal, ConEmu, Ghostty, WezTerm and iTerm2 3.6.6+; `DIM_TERMINAL_PROGRESS=off` turns it off and `on` draws it in any terminal.
- File change feedback: show write/edit results and diff summaries.
- Tool approvals: allow or deny operations during a run, with one-time authorization and remembered permission decisions.
- User questions: answer Agent questions with single choice, multiple choice, multiple questions and custom answers.
- Todo status: show the Agent's task breakdown, current item and completion state; the Agent keeps it with `todo_write` ([Planning](design/plugins/Planning.md)).
- Background tasks: view background processes, subagents and workflows in the Session; open output or conversation details and stop individual or all tasks.

## Branch Agent behavior

- `/agent`: switch Agent mode.
- `/goal`: switch Goal mode; set, edit, pause, resume and clear a goal.
- Goal continuation: continue toward an explicit goal and record completion or blockage.
- `/permissions`: select the session's permission preset and manage command rules; `/approvals` and `/approval` are aliases. The preset is remembered for new sessions.
- Permission policies: read-only, ask (every write and command asks first), workspace-write and full access ([ADR 022](adr/022-the-ask-preset.md)). The Web composer offers them with plan mode as one mode menu: Ask, Accept edits, Auto, Plan and Read only.
- Sandbox: configure file, network and process access; availability depends on the platform and runtime environment.
- Command rules: configure allowed commands and the execution Shell.
- `/compact`: manually compact the current Session context.
- Automatic compaction: compact long context and continue the task.
- `/scheduled`: view and manage scheduled tasks through the scrollback panel; alias `/schedule`.
- Scheduled tasks: create, edit, pause, resume, delete, run immediately and view execution history.
  - Configure recurrence, prompt, working directory, model and whether to create or reuse a Session.
  - Both fullscreen TUI and scrollback can manage tasks and drive scheduled execution through the `schedule` tool.
  - Automatic triggering requires the interactive terminal process to remain alive; skip missed windows without catch-up runs.

## Extensions
