# Client Session catalog

Issue: [#556](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/556), whose required outcome this page serves: a bounded
`/resume` first page and catalog metadata without decoding full effective-context replacements.
[#557](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/557) adds the classification filters this contract reserves a place for;
the fields they select are [Session classification](session-classification.md)'s.
Overview: [Appendix B.2](../overview.md#b2-app-server-process-plugins), Rpc and SessionStore rows. Scope:
[ADR 002](../../adr/002-plugin-scope.md) process scope, in the existing Agents and Rpc built-ins, with one new Rpc
built-in. Consumers: clients through `session.catalog` and `session.summaries`, first the CLI's `/resume` picker.
Rules: [design rules](../../architecture/rust-agent/principles.md), [ADR 002](../../adr/002-plugin-scope.md).

## 1. Summary

A client lists Sessions with `session.summaries`, and that reply is built from history: for every Session the App
Server reads the batches that start within the first 256 events for a preview and then the last event whole for a
time, one Session after another, and replies one array with no page boundary. An imported Session's last event is a
complete `context/compaction`, so a listing decodes the whole catalog's history, and a client sorts and converts all
of it before it can draw a row.

The catalog read becomes bounded work. SessionStore keeps a projection of what a listing needs — per Session its last
activity time, its first user input as the preview, and its workspace — written by the creating transaction and then
by the transaction that commits each `main` batch. A new built-in, `session.catalog`, pages that projection: 50 rows
by default, an opaque keyset cursor, and `query`, `cwd` and `withPreview` applied in the query before the page
boundary. `session.summaries` keeps its contract and reads the same projection, so neither method reads history.

- **Projection.** SessionStore's, written with its batches and from creation; this page owns only how the catalog is
  read (§4).
- **Method.** `session.catalog {limit?, cursor?, query?, cwd?, withPreview?} -> {sessions, nextCursor?}` (§3.1).
- **Lease-free.** A listing loads no Session, restores none, and starts no model, tool or MCP server (§3.4).
- **Clients.** The picker pages, searches on the server and drops a pending read (§6).

## 2. Scope and non-goals

This page owns the reply contract of `session.catalog`, the catalog read of `session.summaries`, the order, cursor
and page-boundary semantics, and the place where #557's filters apply.

It does not own:

- the projection's table, its indexes, write transaction, delete and fork maintenance, and the upgrade's backfill —
  the [native storage format](native-storage-format.md#556-v23-格式决定) decides those;
- the classification fields, their defaults and their presentation — [Session classification](session-classification.md);
- the picker's interaction and its workspace scopes — the client that adds them (§6);
- `session.attach`, and how a client sorts or presents rows.

## 3. Own contract

### 3.1 `session.catalog`

`session.catalog {limit?, cursor?, query?, cwd?, withPreview?} -> {sessions: SessionSummary[], nextCursor?: string}`

| Item | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | Rpc built-in. Agents answers it from the catalog projection, joined with the `agent_sessions` rows and the title metadata; Rpc validates the envelope |
| Protocol | v3. v1 and v2 reply `unknown_method` ("Method requires protocol v3"), as they do for `session.summaries` |
| Discovery | `hello.features` lists it only while a native store is open, the condition `session.fork` uses, so a client that does not see it keeps using `session.summaries`. Without a store there is no projection to page, and `session.summaries` answers from the loaded Sessions as today (§3.3). `session.catalog.workspaces` is listed beside it, under the same condition, and tells a client that `cwd` accepts a set |
| `limit` | 1 to 200, default 50. A larger one is rejected, not clamped, as `history`'s `limit` is |
| `cursor` | Opaque. It encodes the last returned row's `(updatedAt, sessionId)` and a digest of the request's `query`, `cwd`, `withPreview`, `withInternal` and `withAcpSessions`; it pages by keyset, and a client echoes it back unchanged. `cwd` enters the digest as its canonical set: `"a"` and `["a"]` are one filter, and so are `["a","b"]` and `["b","a"]`. It is not a Session id |
| Order | `updatedAt` descending, then `sessionId` ascending |
| `query` | Case-insensitive, literal substring match over the four fields the picker searches today — the Session id, the workspace, the model id and the preview — plus the title and the provider id, which its search text never holds. At query time a SQL function the store registers on its connection lowercases the query and each field with `str::to_lowercase`, the picker's fold; the match is `instr(fold(field), fold(query)) > 0` field by field, so it is literal and `%` and `_` match only themselves. It is applied in the catalog query before the page boundary. The model is read from the stored Session config, the value `session.summaries` reports, so the query decodes no event |
| `cwd` | Exact match on the workspace, applied before the page boundary. A string selects one workspace; a non-empty array of strings selects any of them, deduplicated and held in path order. An empty array, or an element that is not a string, is refused `invalid_params` |
| `withPreview` | Boolean, default `false`. `true` keeps only rows whose preview is not NULL, applied before the page boundary, so a client that hides preview-less rows receives a full page of rows it shows; the projection's partial index over previews keeps that read bounded ([native storage format](native-storage-format.md#556-v23-格式决定)) |
| `withInternal` | Boolean, default `false`. `true` lists the Sessions whose origin is `internal`; `false` drops them, applied before the page boundary. What the class means and who writes it: [Session classification](session-classification.md#35-catalog-visibility) |
| `withAcpSessions` | Boolean, default `false`. `true` lists the Sessions whose origin is `acp`; `false` drops them, applied before the page boundary. A Session of an unknown origin (`unknown`) is always listed |
| Reply | `SessionSummary` entries, the shape `session.summaries` returns: a `SessionInfo` record — `origin` and `parentSessionId` among its fields ([Session classification](session-classification.md#33-reported-fields)) — with `preview`, `updatedAt` and `closed`, false here because this query leaves closed Sessions out (§3.3). `nextCursor` is absent on the last page |

A `cursor` that does not decode, or whose digest does not match the request's `query`, `cwd`, `withPreview`,
`withInternal` and `withAcpSessions`, is rejected as `invalid_params` rather than treated as the first page, so a client
cannot silently read the catalog from the start again, or continue one filter set by the key of another. `cwd`
compares there as its canonical set: a one-element list and a single workspace are the same filter, and so are two
orders of one set. A cursor is not
tagged with a store: one taken from another store's catalog cannot be told apart, and needs no check, because it only
positions a keyset in the same order.

A search with a rare match scans the catalog's rows: the filters read the projection, the stored title and the stored
model, and no filter decodes an event. Registering that function needs rusqlite's `functions` feature and no new
dependency. The fold runs at query time, so no folded value is stored and none has to be kept in step with the title
or the model.

The two classification filters prune rows while the query walks its activity index and the page stops after one row
past its limit, so a filtered page costs one page plus the rows it hides, and visits only the `agent_sessions` row it
already joins. They add no index: the cost and the reason are
[Session classification §3.6](session-classification.md#36-cost-of-a-listing).

### 3.2 Order, cursor and paging

The order is the projection's activity time, newest first, with the Session id breaking a tie, so a page is a
contiguous run of one total order and the same store always pages the same way. The cursor is the last row's key, not
a position: a Session that becomes active between two pages moves to the first page, and the later pages neither
repeat nor skip any other Session. It also carries the filters it was taken under (§3.1), so a page boundary can be
continued only by the same `query`, `cwd`, `withPreview`, `withInternal` and `withAcpSessions`. A set of workspaces
pages across its Sessions in that one order; its cursor continues under the same set in any order, and under no other
set or single workspace. A single workspace's cursor continues under that workspace written as a one-element list.

### 3.3 `session.summaries`

`session.summaries` keeps its reply type and its per-client protocol v3 rule; its parameters gain the optional
`includeClosed` below. With a native store open
it answers from the same projection instead of reading history, and its contents do not change: the projection
applies the preview rule below unchanged, its row exists from the Session's creation (§5), and the read applies
neither classification filter, so a Session of any origin is listed, with the two fields every v3 item now carries. A
daemon without a store has no projection and answers from the loaded Sessions as today; it does not list
`session.catalog` either (§3.1). So the method is how a client that does not find `session.catalog` lists, and how
clients on a daemon older than this change list; both stay working because the method's shape does not change.

**Open Sessions and `includeClosed`.** A Session this daemon closed, through `session.close` or ACP's
`session/close`, keeps its stored rows but stays out of every catalog read: the admission slot's closed flag
([idle unload §6.4](idle-unload.md#64-admission-slots)) filters the same catalog query, so a resume picker never
offers a Session this daemon refuses to attach. Cleanup reads stored data, which such a Session still has, so
`session.summaries` takes `includeClosed?: boolean`, default `false`. When it is `true`, the same query runs without
the closed filter and each summary of a closed Session carries `closed: true`; every summary carries `closed`, false
for a Session this daemon did not close. One read answers either way: the flag removes a condition of the query
rather than adding a second one. An App Server before this parameter refuses it `invalid_params`
(`deny_unknown_fields`), so a client that needs the closed rows re-reads once without it. A daemon without a store
answers from its loaded Sessions as before, with the same `closed` fact from the slot.


**The preview keeps today's rule, its batch-complete window included.** The window is the batches that start within
the first 256 `main` events, and it is batch-complete as today's read is: the batch that holds sequence 256 is read
whole, so a user input just past 256 in that batch is inside it. The first `input/message` that carries a user part
among the window's events decides the preview: that part's text blocks joined with newlines, cut to 120 characters and
ending in `…` when the text is longer. The decision is final — a first user message whose text is empty (an image-only
message, for example) leaves `preview` NULL and no later message fills it, and a Session with no such message in the
window keeps NULL. The projection applies the same rule live as in the backfill: a batch may set `preview` only while
the row's preview is still undecided and the deciding message lies in the window, and once decided it never changes.
Backfilled and live rows are therefore column-identical
([native storage format](native-storage-format.md#556-v23-格式决定)). Dropping or narrowing the window would be a
separate, visible change to what `session.summaries` lists.

### 3.4 Lease-free

A catalog read never loads, restores or starts a Session: the projection answers the stored fields, so a listing costs
no model, tool or MCP startup. `running` and `attachedClients` come from the process's in-memory state, as
`session.summaries` reads them: an unloaded Session reads as not running, and neither field is stored, so reading them
takes no lease and loads nothing.

### 3.5 Catalog filters (#557)

Visibility filters are conditions of the same catalog query and apply before the page boundary, so a match on a later
page is never hidden by what the page already fetched. [#557](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/557) adds two,
`withInternal` and `withAcpSessions` (§3.1), which select the creation origin a Session records; what each class means,
who writes it and why `unknown` is always listed is [Session classification](session-classification.md#35-catalog-visibility).
A row's position, the cursor and the client's row count stay consistent across refreshes with them in place.

### 3.6 Archive classification

`session.archive {sessionId, archived: boolean} -> {}` is a protocol-v3 built-in advertised only with native
storage and Session execution. Agents routes it to SessionStore without loading or closing the Session.
The write is idempotent, validates the Session identity and protocol owner, and returns only after its transaction
commits. A missing Session fails `session_closed`. `true` archives; `false` restores the catalog classification.
Archiving does not stop a running turn, close a Session, delete history, or change its activity ordering.

`session.catalog` accepts `archived?: boolean`, default `false`; `true` lists only archived Sessions.
`session.summaries` accepts the same optional filter, but omission preserves its existing all-classifications view
for cleanup clients. Both replies add `archived: boolean`. The filter is applied before the page boundary and is
part of the cursor digest. A daemon without storage reports loaded Sessions as unarchived and cannot archive them.

The durable rows belong to SessionStore ([native format v34](native-storage-format.md#session-archive-v34-格式决定)).
Delete removes the archive row in the same visibility transaction, and a fork starts unarchived. Client mutation
replies publish no Timeline fact: the caller refreshes its catalog after success, and reconnects read the same
persisted classification. The sidebar requests unarchived summaries; Settings pages archived catalog rows and
restores them with `session.archive` before reloading the sidebar. Deletion still requires the existing explicit
confirmation. The sidebar disables archive while its Session is running.

### 3.7 Cancelling a read

`session.catalog.cancel {requestId} -> {}` cancels an in-flight `session.catalog` or `session.summaries` read on the
same connection. An absent, completed or non-catalog request is a no-op. Protocol v3 advertises this method with
the native catalog. Cancellation never addresses another connection or a mutating request. The cancelled read
returns `cancelled`; a result already completed remains completed.

Closing a connection also cancels its reads. SessionStore checks cancellation before executing a queued read and
interrupts an executing SQLite catalog query. It removes the query's cancellation hook before releasing the shared
connection, so cancellation cannot interrupt a later write. RPC ownership lasts until the SQL operation settles.

## 4. Events and state

Catalog reads write no event and own no state. Archive classification is SessionStore-owned durable metadata (§3.6). The projection is derived state: every column follows from events the
Timeline already holds, and the upgrade rebuilds it once for the whole store from them
([native storage format](native-storage-format.md#556-v23-格式决定)). The creation class and the parent are not taken
from the projection: they are creation input, recorded on the stored Session record and read from the row this query
already joins ([Session classification §4](session-classification.md#4-events-and-state)). Nothing here enters the
Timeline: the catalog is display data for a picker, which
[design rules §4 rule 9](../../architecture/rust-agent/principles.md) keeps out of it.

## 5. Dependencies

| Dependency | What this part requires |
| --- | --- |
| SessionStore catalog projection | One row per Session with the last activity time, the preview and the workspace, written by the creation transaction with the creation time and no preview, kept by the transaction of every later `main` batch, and absent for a Session that does not exist: the row is 1:1 with `agent_sessions` from creation, so a new Session lists as `session.summaries` lists it today |
| Stored Session record (`agent_sessions`) | The creation origin and the leader link of every listed Session, read from the row the query joins, and the filter of §3.5 ([Session classification](session-classification.md#31-the-origin)) |
| [Title metadata](session-title-metadata.md) | The stored title of a Session, joined for display and for `query`, never read from a Session |
| `hello.features` (App Server) | The method list a client discovers the catalog through: the catalog is listed under the conditions that list `session.summaries`, plus the native-store condition `session.fork` also requires |
| Agents' catalog read | The protocol-version and agent filtering the catalog applies, as `session.summaries` applies it |
| Agents' index and the connection hub | The live `running` and `attachedClients` of the listed Sessions, read from the process's state without a lease, as `session.summaries` reads them |

No Session facade call, no lease and no other plugin service is used.

## 6. Clients

The picker behind `/resume` is the first consumer, and this page states what it requires of a client; the client's
own design owns its interaction.

- **First page.** The catalog requires nothing of the filter a client's first page carries: `cwd` applies before the page boundary, so the first page is full of the rows the chosen scope shows. A client sends the same `cwd` with every page of one scope, and `/resume` opens on the launch workspace's exact path ([CLI commands](../cli-commands.md#the-resume-picker)).
- **Pages.** The picker asks for the next page as the selection nears the end of the loaded rows, and keeps the
  server's order across pages. It sends `withPreview`, because it hides rows without a preview today, so its first
  page is a full page of rows it shows and the trigger near the end always has rows. Every cold launch creates a
  Session that may never get a message, so without the filter the newest rows would often be ones it hides.
- **Search.** Its filter goes to the server as a debounced `query`, instead of narrowing only the rows it holds, and
  the server matches the fields it searches today — the Session id, the workspace, the model id and the preview —
  plus the title and the provider id, under the same Unicode fold, so a match on a page it has not fetched still
  appears.
- **Cancellation.** Closing, refreshing or replacing a search sends `session.catalog.cancel` for the pending read
  when advertised, then drops its local request identity. A command entered afterwards does not wait for the obsolete
  query. An older daemon without cancellation discovery retains its existing behavior.
- **Visibility.** The picker asks for conversations: `withInternal` off, and `withAcpSessions` from its persisted
  "Show ACP sessions" preference, off by default. It sends either only when `session.catalog.origins` is advertised,
  labels a row by the origin it reports, and shows the parent of an internal row it lists
  ([Session classification §3.8](session-classification.md#38-client-requirements)).
- **Fallback.** A daemon that does not advertise the method is listed through `session.summaries`.

```text
/resume -> [saved Sessions | search...]
             Esc       -> cancel read -> composer
             Ctrl+R    -> cancel read -> refreshed first page
             new query -> cancel read -> matching first page
```

Which Sessions a client lists first is its own decision: `cwd` exists in this contract for it and applies before the
page boundary. The CLI's `/resume` owns its scopes and the key that cycles them
([CLI commands](../cli-commands.md#the-resume-picker)); a client that lists every workspace keeps sending no `cwd`.
[Clients](../clients.md#32-session-management) records what each client covers.

## 7. Decisions

| # | Decision | Rejected alternative | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | The cursor is opaque and pages by keyset on `(updatedAt, sessionId)` | Offset paging with `offset` or `skip` | An insert shifts every later row, so an offset page repeats or skips Sessions the client already showed |
| C2 | A new built-in, `session.catalog` | Adding `limit` and `cursor` to `session.summaries` in place | Its reply is an array; changing it breaks every protocol v3 client of that method, and an array has no page boundary to keep |
| C3 | The preview and the activity time are read from the projection | Computing them per request from history | That is the cost this design removes: it reads every Session's history, and an imported Session's last event is a complete compaction replacement |
| C4 | `query` and `cwd` are applied in the catalog query | Filtering the rows the client already loaded | It hides matches on pages the client has not fetched |
| C5 | `session.summaries` keeps its contract and reads the same projection | Leaving it on the history read; removing it | It is how a client lists without the new method, and once the projection answers both, keeping its contract costs nothing |
| C6 | Neither method takes a Session lease | One lease per listed Session | A lease restores and pins every listed Session; the projection, and the process's live state for `running` and `attachedClients`, answer without one |
| C7 | The preview is today's rule over its batch-complete window, applied identically by a live batch and by the backfill | An unbounded live rule, writing the preview with the batch that carries the first user input; a strict cutoff after sequence 256 | It changes what `session.summaries` lists for a Session whose first user message follows the window, or whose first user input is just past sequence 256 in the batch that holds 256, and leaves backfilled and live rows different. Dropping or narrowing the window is a separate, visible change |
| C8 | `withPreview` drops preview-less rows in the catalog query, over the projection's partial index | A client that fetches pages until it holds enough rows it shows | A cold launch creates a Session that may never get a message, so the newest rows are often preview-less and that loop reads an unbounded run of them; the partial index keeps the server read bounded |
| C9 | `query` folds both sides with Unicode `str::to_lowercase` at query time, as the picker does | ASCII-only matching through SQLite's `LIKE`, which folds ASCII alone | It would silently miss accented and non-Latin case pairs the picker finds today |
| C10 | The default page lists `client` and `unknown` origins; `internal` and `acp` are opt-in through the two filters | Filtering every non-`client` origin out by default | An imported or otherwise unmapped Session must not disappear from the only list a user has; the crowding this issue fixes comes from the two classes whose records exist |

## 8. Changes to other documents

- [Session classification](session-classification.md): the origin and parent fields, the creation entries that write
  them, the v30 storage column and what a client does with them; this page keeps the query they select and their place
  before the page boundary.
- [Native storage format](native-storage-format.md#557-v30-格式决定): the `agent_sessions.origin` column and its upgrade
  step, beside the catalog table, its two indexes, the same-transaction write from creation on, delete and fork
  maintenance, and the upgrade's backfill and its one-time cost.
- [Session deletion and fork](session-deletion-and-fork.md#32-sequence): its delete and fork row lists name
  `session_catalog` beside the other rows they remove and write.
- [Documentation index](../../INDEX.md) lists this page.
- [Clients](../clients.md#32-session-management) §5 names `session.catalog` where the live Session list row names
  `session.summaries`, and the CLI documents `/resume`'s paging, server search and cancellation. Both describe
  behaviour that exists only once the client ships them, so the client's implementation makes those two edits.

## 9. Rule check

| Rule | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| §4 rule 1 (a command changes another owner's state) | Nothing is written. The catalog reads rows SessionStore owns, through Agents |
| §4 rule 2 (handover) | None: a read hands nothing to another module |
| §4 rule 3 (before callbacks) | None |
| §4 rule 4 (no business meaning in core) | No core change; the projection is SessionStore's business row |
| §4 rule 5 (batch) | The row is written in SessionStore's existing batch transaction; the catalog adds no batch and no event |
| §4 rule 6 (model context) | Unchanged: no event, so no context path |
| §4 rule 7 (public events and services) | Agents answers from SessionStore's stored rows, as `session.summaries` does; Rpc reaches neither the store nor another plugin's state directly |
| §4 rule 8 (infrastructure unchanged) | The Timeline, Dispatcher, event envelope and format, assembly and the Session facade are unchanged. The store gains a derived table and no event, by the storage page's own format decision |
| §4 rule 9 (only facts later decisions use enter the Timeline) | The catalog is picker display data, so it stays out of the Timeline; no event is added |
| ADR 002 D2 (no wiring module) | No new plugin: Rpc's built-in and Agents' existing directory answer it |
| ADR 002 D5 (language-neutral contracts) | §3 is the contract as data; the Rust spelling is the implementation's |

## 10. Acceptance (flow tests)

- A first page of 50 by default, an explicit `limit` within 1 to 200, and a last page without `nextCursor`.
- Paging by the returned cursor returns every remaining Session exactly once in the stated order, including when a
  Session is updated between two pages.
- `query` finds a Session by each of its six fields — the title, the preview, the Session id, the workspace, the
  model id and the provider id — without regard to case, including a case pair outside ASCII, and finds a Session
  that is only on a later page; `cwd` matches the workspace exactly; `withPreview` leaves out a Session with no
  preview; all apply before the page boundary.
- A `%` or `_` in `query` matches only that character.
- A page with `withPreview` returns `limit` rows even when many preview-less Sessions precede them in the order.
- A cursor returned for one combination of `query`, `cwd`, `withPreview`, `withInternal` and `withAcpSessions` is
  rejected as `invalid_params` when replayed with another.
- A page with a two-workspace `cwd` lists both workspaces' Sessions in the stated order, and paging with a small
  `limit` crosses from one workspace into the other.
- A cursor taken under a `cwd` set is accepted under the same set in another order, and refused under any other set or
  single workspace; a cursor taken under a single workspace is accepted under that workspace written as a one-element
  list.
- An empty `cwd` array, and an array with an element that is not a string, are refused `invalid_params`.
- A daemon with a native store advertises `session.catalog.workspaces` beside `session.catalog`.
- A page holds rows of the classes it asked for: with 60 internal Sessions newer than 50 conversations, a 50-row page
  with `withInternal` off holds 50 conversations, and paging returns the rest exactly once; `withAcpSessions` behaves
  the same for ACP rows, and `unknown` rows are always listed.
- `session.summaries` still lists every stored Session, internal and ACP ones included, with the two fields every v3
  item carries.
- A Session created and never written to is listed from its creation with `updatedAt` equal to its creation time and
  no preview, as `session.summaries` lists it today.
- The preview keeps its batch-complete window and its finality: a user input just past sequence 256 in the batch that
  holds 256 lists as the preview, both live and after a backfill; a Session whose first user message is in a batch
  that starts after sequence 256 lists with no preview; and one whose first user message is image-only lists with no
  preview that a later message fills.
- A daemon with no native store does not list `session.catalog`, and its `session.summaries` answers from the loaded
  Sessions as today.
- A Session whose `main` ends in a full `context/compaction` is listed with its stored preview without decoding that
  event.
- A listing taken while the Session is idle unloaded replies the same stored fields as while it is loaded, reads it
  as not running, and starts no model, tool or MCP server.
- `session.summaries` keeps its reply shape and contents for protocol v3.
