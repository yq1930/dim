# Overall design: plugins for undesigned features

Status: Draft

This document starts from the [CLI feature list](../feature-list.md), identifies the features that existing plugins do not cover, and places the new plugins in the existing system. Each new plugin is designed in `docs/design/plugins/<Name>.md`. Supplements to existing plugins are listed in [Appendix B](#appendix-b-supplements-to-existing-plugins) and designed by the plugin that owns them.

> **Scope rule** ([ADR 002](../adr/002-plugin-scope.md)): a plugin part lives at the scope that owns its state and lifecycle (process, Session or branch), and parts integrate only through mechanisms the runtime already has. No new mechanism is introduced. Every contract is language-neutral (D5): a named service with a scope, an instance key and data-only methods, so plugins in any language provide or use it ([§3.1](#31-contract-form)). The two contracts describe supplements to existing interfaces: [methods and tool contributions](contracts/session-boundary.md) (Rpc, ToolRegistry) and [session access](contracts/session-access.md) (Agents, the Session facade, InputQueue).

The main body covers premises, the scope diagram and assignment, integration, the catalog, key flows, constraints, events, phases and open questions. The appendices cover feature ownership, supplements to existing plugins, the implementation language, the CLI layer, the document template and the requirements raised to mechanism owners.

## 1. Scope and premises

| Item | Convention |
| --- | --- |
| Terminal form | Only scrollback is designed. Items marked "full-screen TUI only" in the feature list are out of scope |
| Multimodality | All categories are targeted (image, video, speech, music, audio, 3D assets, motion, realtime, OCR). "Specific Desktop builds only" is an availability constraint ([Modality](plugins/Modality.md)) |
| Not planned | The Todo status and the `plan` Skill |
| Dynamic events | Assumes [#2](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/2): Timeline checks only the envelope and reserved core domains, and carries event types the core does not define as opaque data; there is no type registry, and a capability's event declaration is a descriptive contract |
| Model context | Per [ADR 001](../adr/001-harness-foundation.md): the model sees only adopted input and tool results, and plugin events are not projected. #2 follows the same boundary ([§9](#9-open-questions)) |
| Configuration | [ADR 002](../adr/002-plugin-scope.md) D4, corrected by [ADR 007](../adr/007-plugin-configuration.md): structural plugin configuration (installed, which plugin a name uses, turned off, package paths) lives in PluginManager's `plugins.json`, is carried out on loader rows by PluginManager ([PluginManager](plugins/PluginManager.md), #3) and may reload the row. Business configuration lives in the owner's named Settings sources, is read at use time and never reloads; Settings serves Rust owners through S8a and declared TypeScript owners through the implemented S8b named service ([§6.4](#64-conventions), [roadmap](roadmap.md) S8a/S8b). Project files keep their own authority (ADR 001); project files in a directory, such as Workflow's `.dimcode/workflows/*.yaml`, are not Settings sources (Hooks' `.dimcode/hooks.json` is one: `HooksSettings` reads it through FileStorage, and only Hooks' user document is its Settings source `hooks`; MCP's root-level `.mcp.json` is the project file of its Settings source) and are read by their owners through FileStorage; commands that such configuration runs need no approval (§6.4 Approval scope). The project directory is `.dimcode/` |
| Existing design | [Time bus](../architecture/rust-agent/time-bus.md), [design rules](../architecture/rust-agent/principles.md), [single-tree assembly](../architecture/rust-agent/single-tree.md), [lifecycle](../architecture/rust-agent/lifecycle.md), [event-driven flows](../architecture/rust-agent/event-driven-flows.md), [tool contributions](../architecture/rust-agent/tool-contributions.md) and the ADR 001 trust contract apply |

Green parts are new and orange-bordered parts are changed. Each new plugin part sits at the scope that owns its state. A feature with parts at two scopes is one plugin package with one part per scope, as SkillsCatalog, Skills and SkillsBranch are. Optional Session and branch parts are installed only when the plugin is enabled, never as placeholders.

| Plugin | Process | Session | Branch | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Questions | — | `ask_user` tool; `session.question.*` methods; in non-interactive Sessions `ask_user` answers that no one is available to answer | — (waiters of running `ask_user` calls live in the Session part; no events, the answer is the tool result) | The waiter is the Session-scoped tool handler's own call |
| Goal | — | `goal_update` tool and `session.goal.*` methods, which only write one `input/message` with `goal:objective` and/or `goal:status` keyed blocks | Goal state folded in sequence order from consumed goal change blocks; continuation decided by Goal when it consumes `turn/end`, `stop/interrupt` or `input/deleted` through the Dispatcher | A goal belongs to exactly one branch: the fold uses only that branch's own events, so child branches and forked Sessions start with no goal; continuation follows its events in order |
| Hooks | Configuration (`hooks`, `hooks-projects` and `hooks-plugins` Settings sources, `hooks.*` management methods and plugin `register`/`withdraw`/`plugins()`, `HookSources` port) in App Server | Hook documents (user, project and plugin); runner; a submit check registered with the Session's `submitChecks`, which the operator-input entries call (`UserPromptSubmit`) | advice registered with Permission (`PreToolUse`); `PermissionRequest` answered through Approval; `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `Stop`, `SessionStart`, `Notification` from the Dispatcher | Rules apply to a Session; execution happens in a branch |
| ShellInput | — | `shell.*` Session methods; runs in the Session's workspace and writes its input | — | Commands belong to the Session |
| Attachments | — | `attachment.put`; Session files through SessionStore | — | Attachments are Session data |
| SessionGrants | — | `session.grants.add/remove`; grants stored by SessionStore and read by Permission | — | A grant belongs to exactly one Session |
| Web | — | `web_search`, `web_fetch` tools | — | No state shared across Sessions |
| SessionTitle | — | Observes the adoption (`input/applied`) of the first user input through the Session broadcast; `session.rename`; title stored by SessionStore | — | The title belongs to the Session |
| **Withdrawn (Notifications withdrawn).** Notifications | — | Observes the Session broadcast; `notify` tool | — | Triggers are the Session's events |
| Scheduler | Triggers, run history; jobs in the Settings business source `schedule` | `schedule` tool | — | Schedules span Sessions |
| Workflow | Runs; definitions in the Settings business source `workflow` or project files | `workflow` tool | — | A run spans Sessions |
| ExternalAgent | Live external conversations, Collaboration member kind | — | — | External agent conversations and processes are shared host resources |
| Modality | Tasks, realtime connections | — | — | Tasks and provider connections are shared |
| PluginManager | Plugin configuration (`plugins.json`) | `PluginTools` (`plugin` tool) | — | Installation is per host |
| RemoteGateway | Remote entry, devices | — | — | An external entry |
| AcpGateway | client host process | — | — | A reusable client-process plugin, outside the daemon |

Management is not a plugin. Management methods are client RPC methods about the host rather than a Session ([definition](contracts/session-boundary.md)); process plugins provide them, by registering their namespaces with `managementMethods`, the process's method table. Every rutis session exports that service to its far end, a language runtime or a UI leaf, so code running there can register namespaces too; it is trusted local code ([rutis 0.19 upgrade M8](rutis-0.19-upgrade.md#m8-the-ui-leaf-is-a-plugin-whose-life-is-a-session)). Session methods have no level. Rpc serves a local connection Session and management methods, never serves management methods to a connection with a `deviceId` (a paired device). A rutis session's far end reaches management methods through the exported `managementMethods` service, not through Rpc.

## 3. Integration by existing mechanisms

Plugins never add wiring plugins (ADR 002 D2). Each need maps to a mechanism that already exists at the plugin's own scope:

| Need | Mechanism | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Offer a tool to a Session | Register it with the Session's `toolRegistry` ([methods A.5](contracts/session-boundary.md#a5-tool-contribution)), or register a tool source for a changing set ([tool contributions](../architecture/rust-agent/tool-contributions.md)) | Questions, Goal, Web, Scheduler, Workflow |
| Offer instructions | PromptRegistry prompt sources | Existing |
| Observe a Session's events | The existing Session broadcast (`session/<id>` channel), from a Session-scoped plugin | SessionTitle |
| Observe and act on a branch's events in order | The branch Dispatcher, from a branch-scoped plugin | Goal, Hooks post-tool, turn-end and Session-start |
| Put content into the model context | Branch input (raw blocks, keyed blocks) or tool results ([session access](contracts/session-access.md#a2-source-input-conventions)) | Goal, Hooks, ShellInput, Scheduler, Workflow |
| Act on a write before it is committed | A synchronous Timeline before callback registered by a branch-scoped plugin ([single-tree](../architecture/rust-agent/single-tree.md)): it transforms the draft inside the commit lock, never blocks the write and never waits for external work; the original draft commits on failure ([principles §4 rule 3](../architecture/rust-agent/principles.md)) | None planned |
| Client method about a Session | A namespace registered with the Session's `sessionMethods`, which Rpc dispatches through the Session ([A.1](contracts/session-boundary.md#a1-method-contributions)) | Questions, Goal, SessionTitle, Attachments, ShellInput, InputQueue (`session.input.withdraw`) |
| Host management method | A namespace a process plugin registers with `managementMethods`, looked up by Rpc per call | Existing management methods, Settings (business configuration, `settings.read`/`settings.update`, S8b, implemented), Scheduler, Workflow, ExternalAgent, Modality, PluginManager, RemoteGateway |
| Reach other Sessions | Agents' `sessions` service (`launch`, `input`, `history`, `idle`, ...), as Collaboration does ([session access](contracts/session-access.md#a1-the-sessions-service)) | Scheduler, Workflow |

```

The arrows are dependency edges, and they point to the same or an enclosing scope (D3). Dependencies point from extensions to the core (D3): a core collector never depends on optional contributors. ToolRegistry follows the tools optional plugins register and withdraw, from the next request and without a Session reload ([A.5](contracts/session-boundary.md#a5-tool-contribution), #241), Rpc looks up management method owners on each call (the dotted arrow, [methods §3.2](contracts/session-boundary.md#32-management-method)), and Session assembly lets the optional parts it opens with settle without requiring them to be Active (ADR 006 D3, Publication), so an inactive or reloading provider affects only its own features. Reloads follow only rare structural operations (install, upgrade, enable, disable, crash). Their propagation, including failing in-flight turns, is an accepted and documented cost, and nothing is added to prevent it. Business configuration changes never reload (D4).

### 3.1 Contract form

Every contract the designs define or use is a named service (ADR 002 D5): service name (camelCase), scope, instance key, and methods marked `sync` or `async` whose requests, replies and errors are serializable data. Cancellation is a cancel request or the consumer dropping the call. A plugin declares what it provides in its `provides` and loader row; consumers collect by service name and scope. Tools and method namespaces are registered instead: a part registers a tool with the Session's `toolRegistry` and a method namespace with the Session's `sessionMethods` or the process's `managementMethods`, and the registration lasts until the part unloads. rutis calls such services across languages (rutis-bridge runtimes, `host_key(name)`, `TypeKey::named`), so a TypeScript or Python part satisfies a contract without a hand-written Rust binding. Rust traits, `TypeKey`, `Keyed<T>` and `AgentBuilder` calls appear only in each document's "Rust binding" appendix.

| Service | Scope | Key | Methods | Defined in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sessionMethods` | Session | — | `register(namespace, MethodDecl[], call): async`, where `call(MethodCall, cancelled, progress): async -> MethodReply` is the registering part's function | [methods A.1](contracts/session-boundary.md#a1-method-contributions) |
| `managementMethods` | process | — | same | [methods A.1](contracts/session-boundary.md#a1-method-contributions) |
| `toolRegistry` | Session | — | `register(ToolDeclaration, execute): async`, where `execute(ToolCall, cancelled): async -> ToolResult` is the registering part's function | [methods A.5](contracts/session-boundary.md#a5-tool-contribution) |
| `sessions` | process | — | `launch`, `input`, `lookup`, `history`, `withdraw`, `stop`, `idle`, `delete` | [session access A.1](contracts/session-access.md#a1-the-sessions-service) |
| `scheduleJobs` (optional package, [#317](https://github.com/arcships/dim/pull/317)) | process | — | Session-to-process job operations for the `schedule` tool | [Scheduler](plugins/Scheduler.md) |
| `workflowRuns` (optional package) | process | — | Session-to-process run operations for the `workflow` tool | [Workflow](plugins/Workflow.md) |

The runtime's existing typed services (Timeline, Dispatcher, ToolHost and others) stay as they are. [#4](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/4) is partially delivered: [C4 Session](session-typescript.md) and [C5 branch](branch-typescript.md) bindings expose their documented contract families by name. Additional typed services still need their owners' explicit bindings; rutis itself already calls across languages.

## 5. Key flows

### 5.1 Tool call with a Session tool and Hooks tool advice

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant LP as Loop (branch)
  participant TL as Timeline
  participant TE as ToolExecutor
  participant AP as Approval
  participant PM as Permission
  participant HK as Hooks advice (branch)
  participant TB as ToolBinding
  participant W as Web tool (Session)
  LP->>TL: append step/tool-call [web_fetch]
  TL-->>TE: step/tool-call through the Dispatcher
  TE->>AP: admit({source, call}, risk network)
  AP->>PM: admission decision
  PM->>HK: advise (policy result Allow or Ask)
  HK-->>PM: none / allow / ask / deny
  PM-->>AP: decision
  AP-->>TE: allowed
  TE->>TB: handler from the request snapshot
  TE->>W: invoke
  W-->>TE: ToolResult content
  TE->>TL: step/tool-result after the batch settles
```

Nothing on the Timeline waits for a hook: the advice runs inside Permission's admission decision in ToolExecutor's per-call admission task. A denied call's reason is its error text in ToolExecutor's normal batch `step/tool-result`; Hooks never writes `step/tool-result` ([Hooks §3.1](plugins/Hooks.md#31-pretooluse-through-permission)). The advice port is a Permission and Approval change ([Appendix B.1](#b1-session-and-branch-capabilities)).

### 5.2 Goal continuation from the branch Dispatcher

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant TL as Branch Timeline
  participant D as Dispatcher
  participant G as Goal (branch)
  participant IQ as InputQueue
  TL-->>D: turn/end at seq N
  D->>G: turn/end, in order
  G->>G: fold consumed goal:objective and goal:status blocks
  G->>G: goal active? no stop/interrupt after it? limit not reached?
  G->>IQ: Queue input with dim-goal marker (owned work)
  IQ->>TL: input/message, then turn/start
```

Every goal change (set, edit, pause, resume, clear, and the model's completed or blocked report through `goal_update`) is one `input/message` whose raw blocks carry the key `goal:objective` (set, edit), `goal:status` (set, pause, resume, completed, blocked, automatic pause) or retire both (clear); continuations carry no key and are only counted. Compaction ([ContextCompaction](https://github.com/arcships/dim/blob/roadmap/f1-production-compaction-host-compact-and-u/docs/design/plugins/ContextCompaction.md), F1; branch link until PR #108 merges) keeps the events from `retain_from` (the last turns) verbatim and replays the latest live block of each key placed before it, so the model keeps the current objective and status; it is a Loop step that writes no `turn/*`, so it never triggers a continuation decision. The tool and the `session.goal.*` methods only write that event; they never read Goal's state or decide. Goal's state is the fold of the consumed blocks in sequence order, with no exceptions: the latest live block of each key is the current objective and status, so what compaction replays always equals the fold, and a goal exists only while `goal:objective` is live. Goal decides continuation itself when it consumes `turn/end`, `stop/interrupt` or `input/deleted` through the Dispatcher, from consumed state only; it registers the write as owned work, returns, and rechecks consumed state before writing. Deleted inputs never change the state. A goal belongs to exactly one branch: the fold uses only the events written on that branch, never the inherited prefix, so a child branch and a forked Session's `main` start with no goal and a change there affects only that branch; when Goal consumes a new branch's `branch/start` and the inherited prefix still has a live goal key, it writes one `clear` there as owned work, so the model on the new branch does not take the parent's goal as its own. A `stop/interrupt` pauses the goal. If the interrupt lands after the continuation input, at most one extra turn runs, and the model sees the paused block.

### 5.3 Observer through the Session broadcast (SessionTitle)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant IQ as InputQueue (main)
  participant BC as Session broadcast
  participant ST as SessionTitle (Session)
  participant PR as Provider AuxiliaryModel
  participant SS as SessionStore
  IQ-->>BC: input/applied of the first user input on main
  BC-->>ST: event
  ST->>ST: interactive leader Session without a title only
  ST->>PR: complete(model, adopted text)
  PR-->>ST: title
  ST->>SS: typed write: title, source auto, revision check
  SS-->>BC: title notice for clients
```

A manual title is never overwritten. A deleted input never produces a title, and only adopted text is sent to the auxiliary model. The title is SessionStore process state, not a Timeline fact: SessionTitle writes it through SessionStore's typed write operation, and SessionStore emits a Session broadcast notice that clients consume (constraint 2).

### 5.4 Session method through the Session (Questions)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant CL as Client
  participant Rpc as Rpc
  participant S as Session
  participant QS as Questions sessionMethods
  participant H as ask_user handler
  CL->>Rpc: session.question.respond {sessionId, branchId, requestId, callId, answers}
  Rpc->>S: acquire, sessionMethods "session.question"
  Rpc->>QS: call
  QS->>H: hand the answer to the waiting call (branchId, requestId, callId) (question_not_pending if none waits)
  QS-->>CL: result
```

### 5.5 Scheduled run through Agents

[Scheduler](plugins/Scheduler.md) defines its own design status; its optional package and its public-flow verification are implemented ([#317](https://github.com/arcships/dim/pull/317)), and installation remains explicit under its §1.3. The diagram shows its owned create-mode run flow. S2, Settings and pluginFiles' [public composition](process-typescript.md#52-public-pluginfiles-binding) are available.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant SC as Scheduler (process)
  participant AI as Agents sessions
  participant PF as Scheduler pluginFiles
  SC->>PF: persist run launching
  SC->>AI: launch (S2 creates a non-interactive Session)
  AI-->>SC: sessionId, effective policy
  SC->>PF: persist launch reply
  SC->>AI: input Queue with dim-scheduler marker
  AI-->>SC: published input receipt
  SC->>PF: persist submitted
  loop own run input is not terminal
    SC->>AI: history(main), fixed published prefix and pages
    AI-->>SC: own input consumption and turn facts
  end
  SC->>PF: persist terminal run
  opt report selected under A.6
    SC->>AI: input Steer to recorded report branch
  end
```

The tracker reads its own input's published history as [§3.2](plugins/Scheduler.md#32-completion-and-timeout) defines, with no outstanding native idle wait. It persists the terminal run before one report attempt under [A.6](plugins/Scheduler.md#a6-run-outcome-delivery); failed delivery is recorded and not resent. The target branch consumes the input normally before its text enters model context.

### 5.6 Collaboration delegation to an external agent

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant L as Leader branch (its own model)
  participant C as Collaboration
  participant X as ExternalAgent (collaborationMembers:external-agent)
  participant EA as External agent (bridge on the leader's node)
  L->>C: agent request {agentId: external-agent:<node>:<agent>, prompt}
  C->>X: run (member provider looked up by kind per call)
  X->>EA: prompt over ACP or CLI
  X-->>C: started {extSessionId}
  C->>L: collaboration/delivered; tool result "running"
  EA-->>X: permission request
  X-->>C: ask
  C->>L: member-approval input (Steer)
  L->>L: leader model decides with Collaboration's tool (leader's Permission and Approval)
  C->>X: answer
  X->>EA: allow once or reject once
  EA-->>X: final message
  X-->>C: run resolves {outcome, text}
  C->>L: collaboration/result, dim-agent-report input
```

An external agent is a sub-agent, not a model ([#145](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/145)): the leader keeps its own model and delegates through the same `agent` tool as for dim members. ExternalAgent provides the member kind `external-agent`; Collaboration keeps owning the request, result, wake input and settlement. The agent's permission asks travel on Collaboration's member-approval route (#19) and never enter any model stream (#28). `always` options are never selected ([ExternalAgent §3.2](plugins/ExternalAgent.md#32-permission-asks)).

## 6. Common constraints

### 6.1 Integration methods

The table in [§3](#3-integration-by-existing-mechanisms) is exhaustive. A new plugin part is created only for state or behaviour at its scope that no existing plugin owns, and changes within existing responsibilities are recorded in [Appendix B](#appendix-b-supplements-to-existing-plugins).

### 6.2 Constraints

1. **Minimal events**: add an event only for an outcome that affects later behaviour and cannot be derived from tool calls and results, `input/*`, `turn/*` or `stop/interrupt` (time bus rule 3). Process output goes to diagnostics.
2. **Ownership**: declaring an event type defines its data contract. Producers use the owner's public service. Whoever starts work writes its start and terminal facts. Decisions use only consumed facts, never another plugin's memory. Process-level state with no Timeline (SessionStore title, Provider connection entries, Agents profiles, Settings business sources, plugin storage) never enters the Timeline: writes go through the owner's typed public write operation, and when a UI must show the change the owner emits a Session broadcast notice that clients consume.
3. **External entry**: RPC never writes events. It calls the owning service, which writes (precedent `approval.respond`). Rpc validates only at the external boundary (param shape, `sessionId` authorization); feature checks such as image sniffing, size limits and model capability belong to their owners (the owner of the upload method, the client, or ModelProvider when it builds the request), never to Rpc, a before callback or `session.submit`. Races are decided by Timeline sequence.
4. **Reload and side effects**: work that started but did not terminate is settled as "did not survive recovery" and is never re-executed. Resuming observation of an external job by polling a saved handle is allowed.
5. **Scope**: each part depends only on its own or an enclosing scope (D3). Session and branch parts read the Session's `SessionConfig`. Process parts read a Session only through Agents' `sessions` service.
6. **Interrupt**: a plugin cancels in-flight work and releases resources before writing terminal facts ([interrupt](../architecture/rust-agent/interrupt.md)).
7. **Admission**: new tools declare a risk category. No new Permission category is added: a risk Permission does not know is unclassified, which ReadOnly denies, WorkspaceWrite asks about and FullAccess allows (`permission.rs`); a tool may still declare a descriptive risk such as `persistent_configuration`. Sessions started by automation use the starter's policy as an upper bound, which Scheduler jobs and Workflow definitions may narrow. Runs started by a management method default to read-only unless declared, capped by host configuration. `workflow` uses the `agent` tool's risk category.
8. **Dependency direction and reload cost**: core parts never depend on optional plugins; an optional plugin's reload or failure affects only its own features (D3). A reload that reaches its real dependents may fail their in-flight turns; this is accepted and documented in each plugin's conflict table, never prevented.
9. **Management plane**: management methods (`account.*`, `provider.*`, `mcp.*`, `skills.*`, `settings.read`/`settings.update`, and the methods of new process plugins) are registered by process plugins with `managementMethods`; a rutis session's far end reaches that service too ([rutis 0.19 upgrade M8](rutis-0.19-upgrade.md#m8-the-ui-leaf-is-a-plugin-whose-life-is-a-session)). Session methods have no level; `shell.*` is an ordinary Session method. Local RPC serves both kinds, RemoteGateway serves Session methods only, and a rutis session's far end reaches them through the exported `managementMethods` service (trusted local code). There are no identity tiers. `hello`, `daemon.*`, `agent.*` and the existing `session.*` methods stay Rpc built-ins; `daemon.shutdown` is a built-in never served to a paired device (a connection with a `deviceId`).
10. **Remote Session methods**: paired devices may call every Session method, including `session.permission.update` and `shell.*` (compatibility change, [methods A.4](contracts/session-boundary.md#a4-migration-and-compatibility)).
11. **In-flight work**: there is no shared registry. Each owner provides its own query and stop, and the CLI aggregates them.
12. **Withdrawal**: one contract owned by InputQueue. `input/withdraw {input_id, reason?}` is a command event written by any legitimate producer: clients through `session.input.withdraw` (a Session method InputQueue provides through `sessionMethods`), and process callers through `sessions.withdraw`. InputQueue consumes it in order; only if it still holds that input unapplied (no `input/applied`) does it write the result fact `input/deleted {input_id}` and never apply the input. Otherwise (unknown, applied or already deleted) nothing is written and the caller's reply is `notHeld`. An applied input cannot be withdrawn, and Loop is unchanged. "Withdraw and re-submit as Steer" is one atomic batch. Every pending-input derivation excludes deleted inputs, which never enter model context (their keyed blocks never take effect).
13. **Acting before commit**: a plugin acts on another owner's write before it is committed only through a Timeline before callback, which synchronously transforms the draft, never blocks the write and never waits for external work; the consumers of the write get no plugin-specific changes.
14. **Low business coupling**: raw-block markers and keys, configuration keys and method namespaces carry the owner's prefix. A consumer's choice of model for its own task is its own configuration and is passed to shared services explicitly; shared services keep no per-consumer policy. Collectors never name contributors.
15. **Interactive Sessions**: `interactive` means the Session has an interaction counterpart that can answer its questions and approvals, the user or another Session's or branch's agent ([session access A.3](contracts/session-access.md#a3-sessionconfig-fields)). `session.create` sets `interactive` (clients send it only when false). Exec and automation create non-interactive Sessions; an ACP Session is interactive, since the editor answers its approvals. Assembly does not depend on `interactive`, so the tool set and prompt prefix stay the same across a fork (#30); in such Sessions `ask_user` answers that no one is available to answer. SessionTitle acts only on interactive leader Sessions.

### 6.3 Multiple nodes

rutis nodes connect through connection rows: a connection hands a channel to a rutis session, and the two kernels greet each other with their ids (`LocalId`). A session exports every process-wide shared name to its far end and announces its listener names, so events reach listeners at either end; a plugin runs on the far end as the loader row `<row>:<plugin>`, where `<row>` is the connection's row. rutis-host's `dial` and `listen` rows are such connections; Dim uses none yet ([rutis 0.19 migration](https://github.com/arcships/rutis/blob/v0.19.3/docs/migration-0.19.en.md), [#5](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/5)).

| Rule | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Control node | Hosts the App Server: Timeline, Sessions, configuration sources, Providers, scheduling |
| Resource node | Where host resources live (files, processes, shell, isolation, local CLIs). Each Session will bind one as `SessionConfig.resourceNode`, fixed at creation, an optional field added in P3 whose absence means the control node; in P1/P2 every Session uses the control node |
| Host services | FileStorage, HostPlatform, isolation and the WorkspaceTools host side of the Session's resource node are looked up on each call by the Session's `resourceNode` (#38). Process plugins with no Session (Modality OCR, ExternalAgent bridges) name a node in their own business configuration, read at use time. ExternalAgent's agent processes live in a bridge loader row per node (`<node>:external-agent-bridge` on other nodes, `<node>` being the node's connection row), which attaches itself to ExternalAgent for its own lifetime ([ExternalAgent §3.4](plugins/ExternalAgent.md#34-bridge-lifecycle)) |
| Node-bound data | Isolation configuration and the external agent directory are identified by node and path |
| Offline | A call on an offline resource node fails with `node_unavailable`; dependents do not reload or go Pending. Because node services are looked up on each call by `resourceNode`, an offline node fails only those calls with `node_unavailable`; no requirement is raised to rutis (#38). When the node's session ends, the resource node's own HostPlatform ends the processes it started |
| Authentication | The connection's channel authenticates the far end; the ids in the handshake are self-declared. A session exports every shared name, `managementMethods` included, so a connected node is trusted as host code (AGENTS rule 11) |
| Future | Cross-control-node collaboration is not designed here |

### 6.4 Conventions

| Topic | Convention |
| --- | --- |
| Context | Model context only through tool results and inputs; standing rules through prompt sources or keyed raw blocks |
| Configuration | One source per item, written only through its owner's interfaces. Structural items (installed or not, which plugin a name uses, turned off or not) live in PluginManager's `plugins.json` and are carried out on loader rows only by PluginManager ([PluginManager](plugins/PluginManager.md), #3); no plugin writes its own structural fields. Business items live in Settings sources: an owner has one or more named sources, each holding exactly one document type (MCP owns `mcp` and `mcp-projects`); source names use `[a-z0-9_-]`. Settings depends on no plugin. **S8a (Rust, implemented):** an owner implements `BusinessDocument` for each source (name, user file, optional project file, `validate`, `Default`); a read returns `{revision, document}` and an update is CAS on the revision. Settings has no subscription API of its own: a successful write emits the rutis event `settings.changed` `{source, scope, revision}` on the channel `settings_changes(source)` (`settings/<source>`), for user and project scope alike, never with the body; a newly authorized project emits `settings.project_authorized` `{root, cwd}` on `project_authorizations()`. A consumer listens with `ctx.events().on`, so its listener lives and dies with its own plugin, reads once and then follows the events; `SettingsChanged` and `settings_changes` are declared in `dim-agent-capabilities` so that owners in any crate (MCP, the Skills catalog) listen to the same type. Validation and defaults are applied only at the Settings boundary, on write and when reading a persisted file (a missing file is the default document); consumers use the document as delivered, with no re-validation and no defaults of their own. New native sources are additive `user/<source>` rows under the v13 `settings_documents` contract. **S8b (with the TypeScript bridge C4, implemented):** the language-neutral named `settings` service provides owner reads, CAS updates and the same `settings.changed` events over JSON documents ([Settings contract](appserver/settings-service.md)); every owner, Rust and TypeScript alike, registers its sources at run time from its own process row's `apply` and the registration is withdrawn when that row unloads ([PluginManager §9 R1](plugins/PluginManager.md#9-requirements-raised-to-mechanism-owners)); a declaration has `userFile`, optional `projectFile`, JSON Schema/defaults and `userOnly` pointers, and `BusinessDocument` remains the Rust binding. Writes take one of two paths: the client management methods `settings.read`/`settings.update`, or the owner's typed writes, including those on behalf of its own tool; an owner write on behalf of its tool that changes a user-only field is rejected. A rule JSON Schema cannot express (such as a CIDR) is an owner-side diagnostic at use time. Settings gives no field a meaning: a secret is an ordinary field of its owner's document, and the owner decides whether and how to store or encrypt it ([settings-service §1.2](appserver/settings-service.md#12-decision-secrets-belong-to-their-owner)). Scheduler jobs (source `schedule`) and saved Workflow definitions (source `workflow`, one document mapping name to definition, plus project-enable records) are Settings documents. Project files in a directory (Workflow's `.dimcode/workflows/*.yaml`) are not Settings sources: their owners read them through FileStorage under project-file authority. Hooks' `.dimcode/hooks.json` is one of them; Hooks' Settings source `hooks` holds only the user document. Run records live in `pluginFiles` (extended). RemoteGateway listener settings, Modality's OCR component path and ExternalAgent bridges are business configuration |
| Approval scope | Approval and Permission govern only actions an agent decides (model tool calls). Commands that run because of user or project configuration and not because of an agent decision (an MCP stdio server launched on connect, Hook commands, workflow files, plugins) are that configuration's responsibility, outside the agent system: they run when enabled, with no approval. Feature switches (enable, disable) are plain configuration, unrelated to approval; entries from a project source start disabled and only the user's local configuration enables them. There is no host-local approval ([ADR 003](../adr/003-approval-scope.md)); the former `mcp.approve`/`mcp.revoke` and their approval records are removed ([Appendix B.2](#b2-app-server-process-plugins)) |
| Security settings | Host security settings never enter the Timeline, and replay and fork never restore or widen them. The permission preset is a Timeline fact (`permission/changed`) inherited by child branches and copied with the facts on fork |
| Persistence | Process storage uses `pluginFiles` (extended): per-plugin root, UTF-8 and binary atomic replace, lock, format version ([trusted plugin storage](../../crates/dim-app-server/README.md#trusted-plugin-storage)). Session files live under SessionStore |
| Protocol | Rpc built-ins take precedence over contributed methods |
| Internationalization | User-visible text belongs to the CLI; model-visible text to prompt sources |

## 7. New Timeline events

| Event | Writer | Why it is needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input/withdraw {input_id, reason?}` | Clients (`session.input.withdraw`, provided by InputQueue), process callers (`sessions.withdraw`) | A command ordered against adoption by sequence; the optional `reason` (generic text, no business meaning) is what clients show for a deleted input |
| `input/deleted {input_id}` | InputQueue | Result fact: the held input is never applied; queue state must be rebuildable |

Questions adds no events: a pending question is the `ask_user` `step/tool-call` without its `step/tool-result`, and the answer is the tool result ([Questions §2](plugins/Questions.md#2-data-and-state)).

| Event not added | Used instead | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `goal/*` | Keyed raw blocks, including terminal blocks | Goal state is input |
| `shell/*` | `!command` result written as Append input | Not branch in-flight work |
| `hook/*` | Tool denials as error results written by ToolExecutor, prompt blocks as an `input_blocked` reply with nothing written, context as Hooks inputs ([Hooks](plugins/Hooks.md)) | Hooks declares no event |
| `external_agent/*` | Collaboration facts, approval facts | External agents are Collaboration members; delegation facts are Collaboration's |
| `session/titled` | SessionStore process state written through its typed operation, plus a Session broadcast notice | Does not affect branch behaviour |
| Workflow and scheduled run outcomes | Tool results, consumed report input and `pluginFiles` records | No plugin-owned Timeline event or process-notice requirement |
| Queued message to Steer | `input/withdraw` + new Steer input in one batch | No separate event |

## 8. Phases

Prerequisites always land in an earlier phase than their consumers.

| Phase | Content |
| --- | --- |
| P0 Foundation | `SessionConfig.interactive` set by `session.create`; `sessions` service with `launch`; `sessionMethods` dispatch; `managementMethods` in Rpc's table with migration of existing management methods; tool registration with ToolRegistry; Settings business sources with change notification (S8a); the language-neutral `settings` service (S8b, with C4); `pluginFiles` (extended: binary, format version); Provider `AuxiliaryModel` (one model call outside any Session); SessionStore metadata and Session files; FileStorage listing and removal; HostPlatform argv helper |
| P1 Core interaction | Questions (redesigned, M2), ShellInput, Attachments, SessionTitle; InputQueue withdrawal; Permission rules; model parameters; SessionStore deletion, cleanup and fork; HostPlatform isolation; #4 named exposure of the runtime's typed services for non-Rust parts; CLI subcommands, image conversion, `/export`, `exec --json` |
| P2 Feature extension | Goal, Web, Scheduler, Workflow; Collaboration member approvals delivered to the leader as input; Mcp OAuth; production compaction host |
| P3 External integration | ExternalAgent, AcpGateway, RemoteGateway with Transport `EntryHost` and `ConnectionEntry {name, deviceId}`, Modality; PluginManager; resource nodes (services looked up per call by `resourceNode`) |

The HostPlatform exec-shell change recorded in ADR 002 (business configuration read per spawn) is separate work and blocks no phase.

## 9. Open questions

| Question | Status |
| --- | --- |
| How events enter context | Decided: only adopted input and tool results (ADR 001). #2 was revised on 2026-10-15 to match |
| MCP stdio isolation | Open: whether MCP stdio processes are isolated by default |
| Remote access trade-offs | Open: authentication, disconnection and TLS deployment, related to [#5](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/5) ([RemoteGateway](plugins/RemoteGateway.md)) |
| TypeScript Session parts | C4 tools, Session methods/events and C5 published branch contracts are delivered ([C4](session-typescript.md), [C5](branch-typescript.md)). Provider's named [auxiliaryModel](appserver/auxiliary-model.md#43-named-binding) is available to SessionTitle; Scheduler/Workflow's process/package/management bindings and readiness follow their owner documents (§1.3). Other service families follow their owners' published bindings. |
| Scheduled run outcome routing | Specified in [Scheduler A.6](plugins/Scheduler.md#a6-run-outcome-delivery): the run owner persists history and reports through existing Session input. Design readiness follows Scheduler's owner document; the optional package and its public-flow verification are implemented ([#317](https://github.com/arcships/dim/pull/317)). |
| Scheduled task liveness | Decided: the daemon must be alive ([Scheduler](plugins/Scheduler.md)) |
| FullAccess and new categories | Decided: allowed automatically (constraint 7) |
| External agent permissions | Proposed (#145): an external member's asks use Collaboration's member-approval route; the leader's model decides with a Collaboration tool under the leader's Approval and Permission ([ExternalAgent §3.2](plugins/ExternalAgent.md#32-permission-asks)) |
| External members | Decided (D5, #254): `{leaderSessionId, agentId, extSessionId, cwd}` persisted in ExternalAgent's `pluginFiles` store and reopened with ACP `session/load` or CLI resume after a reload or restart; a failed restore keeps the record and returns `restore_failed`; a member ends only on an explicit `close`; a leader's close or deletion does not cascade ([ExternalAgent §3.5](plugins/ExternalAgent.md#35-restore-after-reload-or-restart)) |
| Permission preset on fork | Decided: no special handling; the preset is copied with the facts, and the application sets a different one after the fork if it wants (#26) |
| Reload propagation | Decided: accepted cost of rare structural operations ([ADR 002](../adr/002-plugin-scope.md) D3) |
| Workflow stages run by a Collaboration member | Future feature: reuse a member's context across stages. Today every stage runs in a launched Session ([Workflow](plugins/Workflow.md)) |

## Appendix B. Supplements to existing plugins

A **supplement** adds services, methods or configuration. A **change** alters existing behaviour or contracts and needs compatibility notes. Event declarations under #2 are descriptive and change no existing event; `input/message` is unchanged.

### B.1 Session and branch capabilities

| Plugin | Type | Content | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Withdrawn (#28).** Approval | Supplement | Accepts a host-source admission (made by ModelProvider for an `approval_ask` stream item) while a model step is open, writing the ordinary `approval/request`, `approval/respond`, `approval/cancelled` facts; generic, with no knowledge of the model kind | ExternalAgent (first user) |
| InputQueue | Change | Consumes `input/withdraw {input_id, reason?}` in order (`reason`: proposed generic optional text, at most 2 KiB, written by any producer and shown by clients; InputQueue ignores it for its decision; events without it are unchanged; design rules §4 rule 9 allow descriptive fields on a required event) and writes `input/deleted {input_id}` only for an input it still holds unapplied (else nothing, `notHeld`); `session.input.withdraw` provided through `sessionMethods` (namespace `session.input`, proposed); "withdraw and re-submit as Steer" as one batch; queue state rebuilt from events ([session access A.4](contracts/session-access.md#a4-withdrawal)) | `Ctrl+S`, `/queue`; AcpGateway, Scheduler |
| Permission, ToolExecutor, Approval | Change | Approval passes `AdmitCall.source` to Permission's admission decision; there Permission calls the advisors registered with it (after policy and command rules, only when not Deny) and folds their `none`/`allow`/`ask`/`deny` advice (deny, then ask, then allow; advice never overrides a Deny); Approval's post-response recheck stays a plain `decide` and does not ask again; ToolExecutor is unchanged. Generic, no business meaning ([Hooks A.6.1](plugins/Hooks.md#a61-tool-advice-in-permission)) | Hooks `PreToolUse` |
| Rpc `session.submit` and `session.branch_create`, InputQueue `InputMethods`, CLI | Change | Before writing operator input (`session.submit`, `session.branch_create {prompt}`, `session.input.withdraw {steer}`), the entry calls the checks registered with the Session's `submitChecks`; a block fails the call with `input_blocked` (message `Hook <source>: <reason>`, `data.appError` only) and writes nothing, else the returned blocks are appended to the input's user content after the operator's own content, so it stays operator input (a new branch's prompt takes none). `input_blocked` joins the `session.submit` errors that guarantee nothing was committed, in the App Server README and the CLI. A caller's disconnect cancels nothing. No event or persistence change. Generic ([Hooks A.6.2](plugins/Hooks.md#a62-submit-check-at-the-operator-input-entries)) | Hooks `UserPromptSubmit`; Skills loads a referenced Skill ([Skills §9](plugins/Skills.md#9-references-load-with-the-operators-input)) |
| **Withdrawn (existing facade).** Runtime Session facade | Supplement | Lookup of `sessionMethods` by namespace: Rpc reads the Session's one `sessionMethods` table through the existing facade, and the fixed-prefix read is composed from it (#50) | Rpc; process callers |
| ToolRegistry | Supplement | Parts of any language register tools with `toolRegistry` ([methods A.5](contracts/session-boundary.md#a5-tool-contribution)) | Non-Rust Session tools |
| Agent assembly | Supplement | Collects the named services each installed plugin declares in `provides`; optional Session and branch parts installed per enabled plugin | All Session plugins |
| Permission | Supplement | Command rules read at use time (no new risk category: unknown risks are unclassified, #45) | `/approvals` |
| ModelProvider | Supplement | When building a request, sends an image in user content or in a tool result, or replaces it with a text placeholder if the model lacks image support or the request cannot carry it; history is unchanged (moved out of Rpc) | Attachments |
| Prompt, PromptSources | Supplement | Prompt's published adopted model configuration; atomic adoption of a profile's prompt and optional model, using PromptSources' existing `dim/session` System entry | `/effort`, `/fast`, `/agent` |
| PromptSources | Supplement | Prompt language source | `/language` |
| ContextPreparation | Supplement | Usage query; manual compaction; production compaction host implementing `ResolveContextModel` | `/usage`, `/compact` |
| FileStorage | Supplement | Directory listing and removal under a root (S6); directory creation (S5a, [session files](appserver/session-files.md#7-filestorage-additions)) | Session files, cleanup |
| HostPlatform | Supplement | OS isolation at process start for agent-decided commands (`exec` and the persistent shell; macOS seatbelt, Linux bubblewrap, Windows explicitly unavailable), per-node host-local configuration; a process start that writes the given bytes to the child's stdin and closes it, for configuration commands such as hook commands, which run without the agent sandbox as MCP stdio servers do ([ADR 003](../adr/003-approval-scope.md) D2, [Hooks A.6.3](plugins/Hooks.md#a63-process-start-with-an-initial-stdin)); exec-argv helper; exec shell read per spawn (ADR 002); when the link to the control node drops, the node's HostPlatform ends the processes it started | Sandbox; ShellInput, Hooks, ExternalAgent |

### B.2 App Server process plugins

| Plugin | Type | Content | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rpc | Change | Method table: built-ins, then `managementMethods` looked up per call without depending on their owners (replacing `When<ProductServices>` and `When<ExecutionServices>`), then the Session's `sessionMethods`; `callChannel` for providers. Management methods and `daemon.shutdown` are never served to a connection with a `deviceId`. `session.create {interactive, origin}`: `interactive` is sent only when false, and `origin` only when the daemon advertises `session.create.origin` ([classification](appserver/session-classification.md)). `session.delete` and `session.fork` built-ins (S5c, implemented: [deletion and fork](appserver/session-deletion-and-fork.md)). Session broadcast notice records forwarded unchanged to attached v3 clients as `session.notice` (C6, implemented: [notices](appserver/session-notices.md)). `title`/`titleSource`/`titleRevision` in v3 Session lists (S5b, implemented: [title metadata](appserver/session-title-metadata.md#8-session-lists)). Validation only at the external boundary (param shape, `sessionId` authorization); `session.submit` checks shape only and no longer validates images ([methods](contracts/session-boundary.md)) | All method owners; SessionTitle |
| Transport, Connection | Change | `EntryHost` with upgrade authenticators; `ConnectionEntry {name, deviceId}` | RemoteGateway |
| Agents | Supplement | The `sessions` service ([sessions service](appserver/sessions-service.md)); `SessionConfig.interactive`; `launch` with a policy capped by the starter, `LaunchRequest.agent` optional (absent: Agents' default profile; request `model` over the profile's model); creation from another Session's cut ([deletion and fork](appserver/session-deletion-and-fork.md#6-fork)); `session.agent.update` through Agents' Session entry, resolving an exact profile ID for prompt/model adoption | Scheduler, Workflow, fork, `/agent` |
| Collaboration | Change | Member model: the user's [subagent model policy](subagent-model-policy.md) (`agent`: the profile's model, else the default selection; `inherit`; `fixed`); [member permission inheritance and tool-approval routing](subagent-tool-approval.md): new native members sample the requesting branch's current policy; pending member approvals reach that branch as adopted inputs, with leader decision tools under its Approval and Permission and [user review of the original action](cli-commands.md#subagent-tool-approval) (#29, #257); member providers by kind (`collaborationMembers:<kind>`, looked up per call) for members that are not dim Sessions, whose asks use the same member-approval route; the `agent` tool keeps its existing risk classification ([ExternalAgent §9.2](plugins/ExternalAgent.md#92-collaboration-member-providers)) | ExternalAgent |
| SessionStore | Supplement | Title metadata with revision checks, written only through `setTitle`, with a Session broadcast notice on change (owners of process-level state emit such notices) (S5b, implemented: the `sessionMetadata` service, [title metadata](appserver/session-title-metadata.md)); deletion and cleanup; fork (copies facts before the cut) (S5c, implemented: [deletion and fork](appserver/session-deletion-and-fork.md)); Session files on the resource node, shared on fork and deleted with the last owner (S5a, implemented: the `sessionFiles` service, [session files](appserver/session-files.md)); `session_grants` rows, removed with the Session and never copied to a fork ([ADR 012](../adr/012-session-grants.md)) | SessionTitle, Attachments, fork, SessionGrants |
| Settings | Supplement | S8a (Rust, implemented): one or more named business sources per owner, each holding one document type; no subscription API of its own: a committed write emits the rutis event `settings.changed` `{source, scope, revision}` on `settings/<source>`, for user and project scope, without the body, and a newly authorized project emits `settings.project_authorized`; validation and defaults only at the Settings boundary; additive `user/<source>` rows under the v13 `settings_documents` contract (D4). S8b (with C4, implemented): the language-neutral `settings` service with JSON Schema, defaults, allowed scopes and user-only fields declared on C4 rows; management methods `settings.read`/`settings.update`; no credential service (§6.4) | Every plugin with business configuration, including user-written Scheduler jobs (source `schedule`) and Workflow definitions (source `workflow`) |
| Provider | Supplement | Validation and mapping of advertised effort/tier preferences against the captured adopted model configuration; `AuxiliaryModel` service: `complete(model, request)`, one non-streaming call outside any Session, with the model passed by the caller from its own configuration ([design](appserver/auxiliary-model.md)); proposed [Desktop/CLI management supplement](appserver/provider-management.md) for safe connection edits, model lifecycle and client-only preferences; non-conversational connections per Modality category | `/effort`, `/fast`, SessionTitle, Modality |
| `pluginFiles` (`PluginFilesPlugin`) | Supplement | Binary read and write and a format version ([trusted plugin storage](../../crates/dim-app-server/README.md#trusted-plugin-storage)); code location unchanged | Scheduler, Workflow, Modality, RemoteGateway, PluginManager, ExternalAgent |
| Mcp, Provider, SkillsCatalog, ManagedProviders, OAuth plugins | Change | Register their existing management namespaces with `managementMethods` (wire-compatible); Mcp's `mcp.approve`/`mcp.revoke` are removed, servers run when enabled, and project entries start disabled until the user's local configuration enables them (§6.4 Approval scope) | Rpc migration |
| ManagedProviders | Supplement | Plan usage query | `/usage` |
| Mcp | Supplement | HTTP/SSE OAuth ([MCP OAuth](appserver/mcp-oauth.md)); keeps plugin MCP configuration registered by PluginManager (`register`/`withdraw`, [PluginManager §9 R2](plugins/PluginManager.md#9-requirements-raised-to-mechanism-owners)) | MCP; PluginManager |
| SkillsCatalog | Supplement | Keeps plugin Skills registered by PluginManager (`register`/`withdraw`, [PluginManager §9 R2](plugins/PluginManager.md#9-requirements-raised-to-mechanism-owners)) | PluginManager |

## Appendix C. Implementation language

| TypeScript first | Rust |
| --- | --- |
| Business rules still need validation | Security boundaries and admission: command execution, approval, before callbacks, isolation, remote entry |
| Mainly external I/O or protocols | Input and Session method boundary |
| Not on the turn hot path | Settlement of in-flight tool calls |
| Failure affects only that feature | Loader and plugin management; base services |

TypeScript process plugins run today as loader rows (Node starts only when configured, [App Server](../../crates/dim-app-server/README.md)). TypeScript parts provide and use the neutral contracts of [§3.1](#31-contract-form) by name. C4 Session and C5 branch bindings are available for their documented families; [#4](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/4) is partially delivered, with additional bindings remaining with their owners (§9). Event-type registration is a separate #2 item (§9). The API-key baseline does not depend on Node: TypeScript-first features ship with a pinned Node and are explicitly unavailable without it. When a plugin moves from TypeScript to Rust, its neutral contracts, event types, tool and method names and storage formats stay unchanged; the move only swaps the loader row, flow tests pass unchanged, and only one implementation is loaded at a time. Existing-plugin supplements are Rust.

## Appendix D. CLI layer

The following are implemented only in the CLI: multi-line editing, input history, command completion, `$` and `@` references, paste and drag-and-drop paths, clipboard, message copy, opening links, `/timeline`, `/export`, `/exit`, `/theme`, `/keys`, interface language, upgrade, VS Code integration, the subcommand system, `exec --json`, the `exec --verify` repair loop, aggregated background tasks, and Modality category listing with unavailability reasons.

## Appendix E. Plugin document template

Plugin and contract documents use this layout:

- A header (status, overview link, phase, language) and a summary.
- 1 Structure: a scope diagram and a part table with each part's scope.
- 2 Data and state.
- 3 Flows: sequence diagrams.
- 4 Timing and conflicts: key races, including reload propagation, in a short table.
- 5 Context mapping.
- 6 Interfaces (summary).
- 7 Security.
- 8 Rule check: a table with one row each for [design rules](../architecture/rust-agent/principles.md) §4 rules 1–9, §1 (Capability and App Server boundary) and [ADR 002](../adr/002-plugin-scope.md) D1–D5, each answered in one sentence or marked "Not applicable: <reason>".
- 9 Requirements raised to mechanism owners: only requirements to the runtime or rutis, with the five items of §4 rule 8 each, or "None". The document that needs a requirement most states it; others link to it. Changes needed from other plugins are listed in [Appendix B](#appendix-b-supplements-to-existing-plugins) and linked from the document.
- Appendices for interface details, the full conflict table (with an `input/deleted` row where inputs are derived), errors and recovery, acceptance, assumptions and open questions.

## Appendix F. Requirements raised to mechanism owners

One row per requirement to the runtime or rutis; changes to other plugins are in [Appendix B](#appendix-b-supplements-to-existing-plugins). The linked document states the five items of [design rules](../architecture/rust-agent/principles.md) §4 rule 8; other documents link to it.

| Requirement | Owner | Issue | Needed by | Five items |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Named contracts for non-Rust parts | Runtime | [#4](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/4), partial: C4 [#63](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/63) and C5 [#64](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/64) delivered | Supported C4/C5 contract families; other bindings remain owner-specific decisions | [C4](session-typescript.md), [C5](branch-typescript.md) |

| Timeline carries event types the core does not define | Runtime | [#2](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/2) | No current consumer (the Questions redesign defines no events) | [Questions §9](plugins/Questions.md#9-requirements-raised-to-mechanism-owners) |
| **Withdrawn (rutis is an external dependency).** Services imported over a rutis link stay registered while the link is down and each call fails with `node_unavailable` (processes on the node are ended by that node's own HostPlatform) | rutis | [#5](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/5) | ExternalAgent, Modality, ShellInput, Hooks, Attachments, Workflow, Scheduler, PluginManager, RemoteGateway | [ExternalAgent §9](plugins/ExternalAgent.md#9-requirements-raised-to-mechanism-owners) |
