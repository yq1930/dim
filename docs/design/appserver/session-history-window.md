# Bounded latest-turn history window

Status: Draft for review ([#712](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/712)).
Scope: the protocol v3 `session.history` read and the
persistence reads behind it. It adds no event, service, plugin or process state.
The process-caller read stays as it is; see [Session access A.1 and A.5](../contracts/session-access.md#a1-the-sessions-service)
and [sessions service §6.7](sessions-service.md#67-history).

## 1. Behavior today

### 1.1 The read

`session.history {sessionId, branchId?, after, limit, through?}` decodes into
`protocol::History` ([protocol.rs:504](../../../crates/dim-app-server/src/protocol.rs#L504))
and is served by `Connection::history`
([connection/tree.rs:75](../../../crates/dim-app-server/src/connection/tree.rs#L75)):

1. It pins `through`: the request's value, or the branch's published head. A
   value beyond the branch's dispatched position fails `invalid`; the call then
   waits until the branch dispatches up to `through`.
2. It reads the page through `AgentIndex::history_page`
   ([agents.rs](../../../crates/dim-app-server/src/agents.rs)): the call acquires
   the Session first, so a Session that unloaded is loaded again before the
   read; a live line pages through the branch's query and the store's
   `batch_end`, and a line that has ended goes through `TreeCommands.page` at
   its fixed head. The client protocol has no page read of stored facts for a
   Session the process does not hold (ADR 021 D3).
   `after` and `through` must end a batch. `limit` is required and must be positive; the v3
   method sets no upper bound today, and clients send 256 or 512. A page takes
   `limit` events and then runs to the end of that batch, so it can exceed
   `limit`; it never passes `through`.
3. It replies `{events, through, nextAfter, done}`
   ([tree_protocol.rs:142](../../../crates/dim-app-server/src/tree_protocol.rs#L142)).
   `events` are the branch's own events, ascending by sequence, filtered to the
   kinds `ProductEvent` shows for the connection's protocol version
   ([tree_protocol.rs:32](../../../crates/dim-app-server/src/tree_protocol.rs#L32));
   the cursors use the raw sequences, so a page can be sparse and still be
   complete.

The method is protocol v3 only
([connection.rs:408](../../../crates/dim-app-server/src/connection.rs#L408)).
Only the `sessions` service caps its own pages at 256 for the bridge
([sessions service D11](sessions-service.md#3-decisions)).

Older events are reached only by a forward page with `after` set to a batch
boundary. The CLI and the web client read a branch from its start to its head,
`ceil(head / limit)` calls, when they open it
([CLI session.rs:442](../../../crates/dim-cli/src/session.rs#L442),
[web chat.ts:290](../../../web/src/stores/chat.ts#L290)); a client that wants the
newest content has to find a batch boundary near the head and walk back from
there, which is what the Desktop reader does (§1.3).

### 1.2 The turn boundary and its input

Every turn begins with one `turn/start` that Loop appends on its own
([agent_loop.rs:181](../../../crates/dim-agent-capabilities/src/agent_loop.rs#L181),
`append` is a one-event batch). So a turn start is a batch start, and the
sequence before it ends the previous batch. A running turn has no `turn/end`;
its start is still the newest `turn/start` of the branch.

The input that drives the turn is written before it: `input/message` carries the
user's content and is appended when the client submits
([tree.rs:19](../../../crates/dim-app-server/src/connection/tree.rs#L19)); Loop
then writes `input/consumed` for each input its first request takes
([agent_loop.rs:415](../../../crates/dim-agent-capabilities/src/agent_loop.rs#L415)),
before that request's `step/model-start`. A client renders the user row at the
`input/message` event ([CLI projection.rs:110](../../../crates/dim-cli/src/projection.rs#L110),
[web projection.ts:60](../../../web/src/projection.ts#L60)), so a window that
starts at `turn/start` alone would show a turn without its prompt.

Nothing indexes the kind. The store can page by sequence and by event id, and it
has a partial index for `step/tool-use-start`
([sqlite.rs:90](../../../crates/dim-app-server/src/storage/sqlite.rs#L90)), but a
reader that wants the newest `turn/start` can only read events until it meets
one.

### 1.3 What a client that opens a thread pays

The cost measured in [#712](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/712) with the
Desktop reader against a native store: a thread open reads the newest page, then
walks back until it meets a `turn/start` or the previous turn's end.

| main head | history pages | App Server history time | open, cold | open, warm | client fold |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1,956 | 1 | 67 ms | 410 ms | 82 ms | 4 ms |
| 3,122 | 6 | 258 ms | 1,193 ms | 335 ms | 8 ms |
| 6,862 | 13 | 420 ms | 1,021 ms | 478 ms | 13 ms |

The newest 512-event pages of the 3,122- and 6,862-event Sessions held 490 and
499 `step/thinking` events and no `turn/start`, so the walk back is bounded only
by the turn's own size. The client's fold after the pages arrive takes 1 to
13 ms: the cost is the reads, not the client.

## 2. Problem

The turn boundary is a stored, server-side fact, but the protocol has no way to
name it. A client cannot ask for "the newest turn" or "the turn that contains
the head", so a long turn makes opening a thread an unbounded backward read, and
the reply that reaches the client is a sequence of pages whose count grows with
the turn. A fixed tail window does not solve it: a tail can stop in the middle
of a turn, lose the `turn/start`, or both, and it does not know which inputs the
turn consumed.

## 3. Decisions

| # | Decision | Rejected alternative | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | Extend `session.history` with two optional request fields (`latestTurn`, `before`) and two optional reply fields (`turnStart`, `nextBefore`) | A new method, `session.history.latest` | The watermark, the batch rules, the v3 event filter and the error set are the same read. A second method would duplicate them, need its own feature entry and split clients between two paging loops. Older clients ignore the new reply fields, and a request without the new fields is today's read (D9) |
| D2 | Window boundaries are sequence bounds, not opaque cursors | An opaque cursor or turn id | Clients already hold sequences, pin a watermark and key events by sequence. A turn id would need a second lookup and would not fix the paging; a sequence is the same currency as `after`, `through` and `nextAfter` |
| D3 | The window is `(windowStart - 1, through]`: the newest turn at or below `through` together with the `input/message` events that turn consumed (§4.2); with no `turn/start` the window starts at the branch start | Start at `turn/start` only | The prompting input precedes the turn start, and clients render it as their user row (§1.2). A window from `turn/start` gives a turn without its prompt. A fixed number of events before the turn start is arbitrary: a queued input can be much older |
| D4 | A `latestTurn` page is the newest part of the window, bounded by `HISTORY_TURN_LIMIT` (4,096 raw events) and aims for `HISTORY_TURN_BYTES` (4 MiB of encoded visible events); when the window is larger the reply is its newest part and `nextBefore` names the cursor for the rest. Trimming happens on batch boundaries and never splits a batch, so one batch above 4 MiB is returned whole. A batch above the transport frame (`MAX_FRAME_BYTES` minus headroom, [outbound.rs:6](../../../crates/dim-app-server/src/outbound.rs#L6)) cannot be sent and the call fails `history_too_large` | An event-count bound alone, no bound, or splitting a batch | Events have no size bound: 4,096 events of large tool results can exceed the 16 MiB frame and kill the connection. 4 MiB is a target that bounds ordinary replies, and 4,096 events makes the measured 1,956- and 3,122-event turns one reply and the 6,862-event turn two. A batch is the Timeline's atomic unit, so trimming inside one would break the fold; the only hard error is a batch the transport cannot frame |
| D5 | `before` adds backward paging: the page ends at the last batch end at or below `before - 1`, and starts at a batch start, so `after = from - 1` reads the same page forward | Read the newest page as `after = head - N`, as [#276](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/276) suggested | `after` must end a batch; `head - N` need not, and when it does not the read fails with "cursor is inside an atomic batch", so the client has to search for a boundary. A backward page has to walk batches from their ends |
| D6 | The turn start and the prompting input are selected reads through one derived partial index, not a scan and not state rebuilt during restore | Fold the newest turn start and the consumed inputs during restore validation; keep them in process memory; or take a native format version | [#601](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/601) makes a re-acquired Session skip validation, so a value rebuilt there would be missing exactly when the read is cheap. Process memory would be dropped on unload. Each read is a selection by kind from the pinned watermark down, independent of the turn's size ([ADR 020](../../adr/020-timeline-read-convergence.md) D6). The index changes no row and no decode, so it is created at open rather than as a format step (§5.1) |
| D7 | A whole-history read keeps using forward paging; the window is opt-in | Replace `after`-paging with backward paging | Clients that show scrollback (CLI, web, export) read from the start and need no window; replacing the direction would change every one of them and the export's fixed-prefix rule |
| D8 | `sessions.history` (the process service) does not gain the fields | Mirror the fields in both reads | It has no consumer that opens a thread; the fields are a client read. Adding them would advertise a contract nothing uses, and the service can adopt the read when a consumer needs it |
| D9 | All new request and reply fields are optional; a request without them keeps today's meaning, limits and errors | A protocol version bump | The wire stays v3; replies only gain fields, and request decoding is strict only for fields the client sends. A client learns the feature from `hello.features` (`session.history.latestTurn`), so it never sends the fields to an older daemon that would reject them as unknown |
| D10 | The first page of a window is the newest part, and the client backfills towards the turn start | The oldest part, so the client folds forward while live events arrive | A thread opens to show the newest content; the oldest part would show the turn's beginning and hide the running output. Live events after the pin arrive as `session.event` either way, and `session.model.progress` keys the open blocks |
| D11 | The forward mode keeps today's contract, including its unlimited `limit`; only `latestTurn` adds a bound | Apply the 4,096-event and 4 MiB bound to every `after` read | Existing clients and the export page with their own limits; changing their accepted requests would break callers without reducing any measured cost |
| D12 | If the pin is the `turn/start` itself and the turn's first request is not committed at `through`, the window starts at the newest `input/message` at or below the turn start; a later read with a new pin can start earlier | Wait for the first request before replying; keep no prompt; treat it as an error | Waiting would make a pinned read depend on events above the pin. The fallback keeps the prompting input in the window. A new pin may legitimately produce an earlier window start, and the same pin keeps every candidate at or below it, so the reply is stable |

## 4. Contract

### 4.1 Request

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `sessionId`, `branchId?` | Unchanged |
| `through?` | The fixed upper watermark, unchanged: default the published head, must not exceed the dispatched position, and the call waits until the branch dispatches up to it. It must end a batch, as today. It also bounds the window: a `latestTurn` read chooses the newest `turn/start` at or below it, and a `before` read never returns events above it. It is accepted together with `latestTurn` and `before` |
| `after?` | Unchanged forward cursor: exclusive, must end a batch. Absent in a window read (rejected there); default 0 otherwise |
| `before?` | Backward cursor: exclusive upper bound. The page ends at the last batch end at or below `before - 1` and never above `through`. Must be at least 1 and at most `through`. Mutually exclusive with `after`; accepted with and without `latestTurn` (without it, the window is the whole branch). Absent on the first window page, where the top is `through` |
| `latestTurn?` | `true` selects the turn window (§4.2). Mutually exclusive with `after`. `false` behaves as absent. It requires the native Session store, like `session.catalog` |
| `limit?` | Raw events per page before the page runs to its batch boundary. Without `latestTurn`: positive, no upper bound (unchanged), default 256 when absent. With `latestTurn`: 1 to 4096, default 4096. The encoded-byte budget of §4.4 can make the page shorter in both window modes |

A `latestTurn` read is newest-first. A read with `before` and without `latestTurn`
is newest-first over the branch. A read with neither is today's forward read.

### 4.2 Window

```
sequence   1     I            T                F              H
           |.....|............|================|==============|
           br.   windowStart  turn/start        page start     through
           start               = turnStart                    (pinned)

latestTurn, whole window (H - I + 1 <= limit):
           events = [I..H]   turnStart = T   done = true   nextBefore = I

latestTurn, larger window:
           events = [F..H]   turnStart = T   done = false  nextBefore = F
           then history {latestTurn:true, before:F, through:H} returns [I..F-1]
```

`T` is the sequence of the newest `turn/start` of the branch at or below
`through`. Without such an event the window is the whole branch: `windowStart`
is 1 and `turnStart` is absent.

With `T`, `windowStart` is chosen in this order:

1. If the turn's first request has `input/consumed` events between `T` and its
   `step/model-start` (both at or below `through`), `windowStart` is the
   smallest of `T` and the sequence of the `input/message` each consumed id
   names. `T` stays the lower bound, so `turn/start` is always in the window
   even when a message was appended between `T` and the request.
2. Otherwise `windowStart` is the smallest of `T` and the newest
   `input/message` at or below `T`. This is the pin-at-`turn/start` case of D12:
   the prompting input stays in the window even though the first request is not
   committed at the pin. With no such message, `windowStart` is `T`.

Every candidate is at or below `through`, so the window is stable while
`through` is pinned.

The rule does not bring in an input consumed by the previous turn:
`input/consumed` is read only in `(T, first model-start]`, which is inside this
turn, and the ids it names are this turn's inputs. The contiguous range from
`windowStart` to `through` can contain the previous turn's tail when the
prompting input was written while that turn ran. That is deliberate: those
events are a valid prefix, the client folds them as it would fold them in a
full read, and nothing is attributed to the new turn. The cost is bounded by
the event and byte limits like any other window.

### 4.3 Reply

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `events` | Unchanged form and ascending order: the branch's own events, filtered as today. Every page starts and ends on a batch boundary |
| `through` | As today: the watermark this read is pinned to |
| `nextAfter` | Forward: as today, the last returned sequence (raw, before filtering), or `after` when the page is empty; the client passes it back as `after`. Backward: the same last returned sequence, or `through` when the page is empty; a backward read pages with `nextBefore` |
| `done` | The end of the read in its direction: forward, `nextAfter == through` (unchanged); backward, the page reached the window start |
| `nextBefore?` | Backward reads: the sequence of the first returned event. Pass it back as `before` to continue, also after `done`, to read below the window. Absent when the page is empty |
| `turnStart?` | `latestTurn` reads only: the sequence of the newest `turn/start` at or below `through`. Absent when the branch has none and when the request is not a window read |

### 4.4 Rules

- `limit` counts raw events, as it does today; the visible page can be smaller
  because `ProductEvent` filters kinds.
- The byte budget counts the encoded `ProductEvent`s the reply carries, not the
  raw rows and not the envelope. A batch is kept whole; the page never ends
  inside one, so a single batch above 4 MiB is returned whole and can make the
  reply larger than the target. Only a batch above the transport frame fails
  `history_too_large` (§4.5); the client can still read that turn with forward
  paging (§1.1).
- A page is batch-complete at both ends. Forward: it takes `limit` events and
  runs to the end of that batch. Backward: it takes up to `limit` events
  downward from the top and runs to the start of the batch that holds the oldest
  taken event. A page can therefore exceed `limit` by its boundary batch, as
  forward pages already can. Only `before` clamps: a `through` inside a batch is
  rejected (§4.5 row 9), so a pinned watermark never silently loses the events
  between the batch end below it and itself.
- A truncated window is a suffix: `done` is false and `nextBefore` is behind
  `turnStart` or inside the turn. The client shows what it has and decides
  whether to load the rest. A window can begin inside a turn, inside a step,
  inside a text or thinking block, or after a tool call started; blocks and
  calls that opened before the window are rendered from the loaded events, and
  their first loaded event identifies them until the earlier page arrives. An
  open block's identity is still read from `session.model.progress`, which
  carries `textPartId` / `thinkingPartId`
  ([clients](../clients.md#timeline-block-identity)).
- Folding the pages of a window in sequence order returns exactly the forward
  read of the same range: same events, same order, no overlap and no gap. A
  client that wants the current-turn state equal to today's fold loads until
  `done`.
- `latestTurn` with `limit` at or above the window size is one reply and folds
  like today's read of that turn.

### 4.5 Errors

Validation runs in this order; the first failure decides the reply. `invalid` is
the existing `-32602 invalid_params`.

| # | Input | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `latestTurn` is `true` and `after` is present | `invalid`: a window chooses its own lower bound |
| 2 | `before` is present and `after` is present | `invalid`: one page has one direction |
| 3 | `before` is present and is 0 | `invalid` |
| 4 | `limit` is 0 | `invalid` (unchanged) |
| 5 | `latestTurn` is `true` and `limit` is above 4096 | `invalid`: the window's page limit |
| 6 | `latestTurn` or `before` is present and the host has no native Session store | `invalid`: the window requires the store; the feature is advertised only with one (§7) |
| 7 | Session or branch resolution | `session_closed` for a missing or closed Session; `session_invalid_input` for a branch the line does not have (both unchanged) |
| 8 | `through` is above the dispatched position | `invalid` (unchanged); otherwise the call waits for dispatch up to `through` |
| 9 | `through` is inside a batch | storage error (unchanged) |
| 10 | `after` is above `through`, or `after` is inside a batch | `invalid` (unchanged) |
| 11 | `before` is above `through` | `invalid` |
| 12 | the newest batch of a window page encodes to more than the transport frame minus 64 KiB | `-32000 history_too_large`: the reply cannot be framed |

Every other combination is accepted: `latestTurn` with or without `through`;
`latestTurn` with or without `before`; `before` with or without `latestTurn`;
`limit` absent (256 forward, 4096 window); `through` absent (pinned at the
published head). `latestTurn: false` is the same as absent. Protocol v1 and v2
never reach the method (unchanged).

The method's error contract, including the new `history_too_large`:

| `appError` | Code | When | Client action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `invalid_params` | -32602 | the request shape, or any validation row above marked `invalid` | correct the request; a page limit or a cursor inside a batch is not retried unchanged |
| `session_closed` | -32000 | the Session does not exist or is closed | stop reading it |
| `session_build_failed` | -32000 | acquiring the Session failed while restoring it | report it; a retry may succeed after the cause is fixed |
| `service_reloading` | -32000 | the Agents index, or a capability the restore needs, is reloading | retry |
| `session_invalid_input` | -32000 | the branch does not exist | correct the branch |
| `history_too_large` | -32000 | the newest batch of a window page alone encodes to more than the transport frame minus 64 KiB, so the reply cannot be framed | read that turn with forward paging (§1.1); no retry of the same window helps |
| none | -32603 | a storage failure or a reply encoding failure; opaque, with a server message | retry, and report if it repeats |

`session.history` returns no other `appError`. The existing `session.submit`
guarantee set and the `sessions` service error table
([session access A.6](../contracts/session-access.md#a6-errors)) do not apply:
those name other methods' outcomes.

## 5. Storage

### 5.1 The derived index

The index is created at every store open, inside the format transaction, and
does not take a native format version:

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS timeline_history_anchors
  ON timeline_events(session_id, branch_id, kind, sequence)
  WHERE kind IN ('turn/start', 'input/message');
```

It is not a format step because it carries no data and no decode rule. Every
supported format's rows produce the same index, it is fully derivable from
`timeline_events`, and a store with or without it decodes to the same events.
The gate in `SqliteStorage::open` ([sqlite.rs:244](../../../crates/dim-app-server/src/storage/sqlite.rs#L244))
still compares the exact schema, except for the derived names: `schema()` omits
them, so a store of the current format without an index is recognised, upgraded if
needed, and gets the index in the same transaction; a store with the index is
recognised the same way. Any other unexpected object still rejects the store.

Consequences:

- The marker stays 29: the index takes no format step, and a newer daemon can
  open every older store of this format.
- An older daemon that predates this change rejects a store that already has the
  index, because its gate does not know the name. Its message says the schema is
  unsupported; no row is changed, and the newer daemon opens the store again.
  The alternative, a format bump, has the same downgrade result for a different
  reason (an unknown version) and would spend a version on a change that carries
  no data and no decode rule.
- The index holds one row per turn and one per user input, unlike the per-event
  indexes that dominate write amplification ([#588](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/588));
  it is a partial index on `kind`, like `timeline_tool_use_starts`
  ([sqlite.rs:90](../../../crates/dim-app-server/src/storage/sqlite.rs#L90)).

### 5.2 Queries

The anchors are selections over the branch's facts, so they are the Timeline
query ([plugin contract §5.4](../plugin-contract.md#54-the-event-query)) over
this branch, each with the kind named and `through` as the start of its read:

- Turn start: `turn/start`, newest first, one event.
- Newest input before the turn, the window's floor: `input/message`, newest
  first from `T`, one event.
- First request: `step/model-start`, oldest first from `T`, one event at or
  below `through`.
- Consumed inputs: `input/consumed`, oldest first from `T` up to the first
  request, then each `input_id`, which is an event id, as one `input/event_id`
  read. A few events, not a scan of the turn.

The backward page is the loaded branch's own read too: the Timeline query
returns the events of `window_start..=through` ascending, and `batch_end` fixes
both ends — the greatest batch edge at or below `before - 1` and the start of
the batch holding the oldest taken event ([ADR 021](../../adr/021-reads-follow-the-state-owner.md) D1).
The read does not use `timeline_events_by_end`, which v25 removed
([#596](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/596)). The row model already
allows a physical row to hold several events (`last_sequence`); the query
returns events in ascending order, and the page is whole batches at both ends
(§4.4).

### 5.3 Where the reads live

The anchors and the page are served by the owner of the line's facts: while the
line is open, the branch's Timeline, which `Connection::history` already has the
loaded Session for — each anchor is a kind selection and the page is a range
selection, both through `Session::query`, with `Session::batch_end` for the
page's ends. An ended line's Timeline is gone, so its anchors and its page are
the tree's read at the fixed head it owns: `TreeCommands::query` for both
directions and `TreeCommands::batch_end` for the page's ends
([ADR 021](../../adr/021-reads-follow-the-state-owner.md) D2,
[timeline read ownership §2](../timeline-read-ownership.md#2-owners-and-their-reads)).
A line that ends while its window is read is served by the tree: the owner is
chosen when the read starts, and an answer of `BranchEnded` re-runs the same
request through the tree at the fixed head.
The App Server has no store read on this path. The window requires the native store: a host without one
(`ServerConfig.database_path: None`) advertises no
`session.history.latestTurn` and answers a window request
`invalid`, as `session.catalog` is advertised only with a database path. No
second paging implementation is added. The query rebuilds the requests of the
rows it returns ([ADR 020](../../adr/020-timeline-read-convergence.md) D6);
those records do not reach the reply
([request delta storage §7.5](request-delta-storage.md#75-reads-that-do-not-use-request-bodies)).

The runtime, the Session facade and `sessions.history` are untouched;
`session.attach`, `session.event`, `session.state` and the live delivery path
are untouched.

## 6. Client flow

```
Desktop, opening main (H = the sequence from session.attach)
  session.attach {sessionId}                                  -> SessionInfo, H
  session.history {sessionId, branchId:"main", latestTurn:true,
                   through:H}                                 -> turn window
       the window with its inputs, or its newest part + nextBefore
  session.event ...                                            live events after H
  scroll up inside the window:
  session.history {..., latestTurn:true, before:nextBefore,
                   through:H}                                 -> earlier pages
  scroll into older history (after done):
  session.history {..., before:nextBefore, through:H}           -> newest page below
  ...                                                          until done at 1
```

The attach reply carries the pinned `through` for `main`
(`SessionInfo.sequence`, [protocol.rs:913](../../../crates/dim-app-server/src/protocol.rs#L913)).
Events after the pin arrive as `session.event`; the client applies them after the
window pages, as it already does after forward pages.

## 7. Compatibility

- A request without `latestTurn` and without `before` is today's read, including
  the `after` semantics and the unlimited `limit` (an absent `limit` now takes
  256 instead of failing; no client relies on that error).
- New reply fields are additive. The Rust client's `History` type does not deny
  unknown fields ([wire.rs:216](../../../crates/dim-client/src/wire.rs#L216));
  the web reader takes named fields
  ([read.ts:131](../../../web/src/rpc/read.ts#L131)). Neither needs a change to
  keep working.
- Protocol v1 and v2 never reach the method.
- `hello.features` gains `session.history.latestTurn` next to `session.history`
  ([transport.rs:706](../../../crates/dim-app-server/src/transport.rs#L706)).
  A client that sees it sends the new fields; one that does not keeps the
  forward read. This is the only way to be safe against an older daemon, whose
  strict request decoding rejects unknown fields.
- Existing `after`-paging clients (CLI, web, export, member reads) are not
  changed by this design.

## 8. Other changes and interactions

| Change | Interaction |
| --- | --- |
| [#601](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/601) skips full revalidation when the stored head is unchanged | Independent and complementary. The window's anchors come from indexes, so a skipped validation does not remove them; [#601](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/601) removes the restore scan before the read, and this design removes the client scan after it |
| [#713](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/713) profiles the cold first `session.attach` | Independent. The read stays after attach and acquires the Session like every Session method; if attach already restored it, the window is served from the loaded branch. If #713 later bounds the first attach, the window contract does not change |
| [#588](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/588) / [#596](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/596) read-path audit | The backward page is a range query (§5.2) and does not depend on the removed `by_end` index. The two anchors add partial indexes; they do not change how history pages are read |
| [Restore-scoped shared read](restore-shared-read.md) | The window reads committed facts only; the Timeline reads the store on every read, with no opening copy ([ADR 021](../../adr/021-reads-follow-the-state-owner.md) D6) |
| [Idle unload](idle-unload.md) | Unchanged: `session.history` acquires the Session, and a read during an unload waits for the restore and then serves the window |
| [sessions service](sessions-service.md#67-history) | Unchanged (D8) |
| `session.catalog`, `session.summaries`, `session.event` | Unchanged; none reads the indexes |

## 9. Rule check

| Rule | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| [Principles §4](../../architecture/rust-agent/principles.md#4-通过时间线扩展行为) rule 1 (command events for others' state) | Not applicable: the read changes no state and writes no event |
| §4 rule 2 (handover) | Not applicable: nothing is handed over |
| §4 rule 3 (`before` callbacks) | Not applicable: no producer or draft changes |
| §4 rule 4 (no business meaning in core) | No core mechanism learns the window. The App Server's own persistence read names the turn and input facts it serves; the runtime is untouched |
| §4 rule 5 (atomic batches) | Kept: every page starts and ends on a batch boundary in both directions, and a cursor inside a batch is rejected |
| §4 rule 6 (model context) | Unchanged: the read feeds clients, not the model; no adoption or insertion path is added |
| §4 rule 7 (public events and services) | The window returns published facts from the Session's store; it reads no part's internal state and decides nothing for another module |
| §4 rule 8 (infrastructure) | Unchanged: no Timeline, Dispatcher, event envelope, assembly, lifecycle or facade change. The read is the App Server's own persistence read over the store's existing tables and two indexes |
| §4 rule 9 (only decision facts in the Timeline) | No new fact and no UI state in the Timeline; the indexes are derived from existing facts |
| §1 (Capability and App Server boundary) | No Capability, plugin or loader row. The App Server decodes the request and computes the window |
| §3 (orthogonality) | No other module's design changes; `sessions.history`, attach and live delivery are untouched |
| [ADR 002](../../adr/002-plugin-scope.md) D1 (scope follows state) | No state: a read of the Session's store |
| ADR 002 D2 (no wiring modules) | No new module or plugin |
| ADR 002 D3 (dependencies follow scope) | No new dependency |
| ADR 002 D4 (configuration) | None |
| ADR 002 D5 (language-neutral contracts) | The contract is the v3 wire, not a Rust spelling; any language's client reads it |

## 10. Requirements raised to mechanism owners

None. The design was checked against [§4 rule 8](../../architecture/rust-agent/principles.md#4-通过时间线扩展行为):
the anchors are the Timeline query the contract already fixes, and the page is
the App Server's own read of the Session's store (`read_page`, `read_events`,
`read_tool_use_starts`) over the existing tables plus one index. A Timeline
facade read with an end bound (`Session::local_page_before`) was considered and
rejected: the query carries no end and no batch edges, which are what the page
needs, and `sessions.history` does not need the mode (D8).

## 11. Acceptance

The implementation in this change carries these.

1. **One request for the newest turn.** A turn larger than one client page
   whose newest 512-event page contains no `turn/start` is served by one
   `session.history {latestTurn: true, through}` reply: the whole window when it
   holds at most 4,096 events, otherwise its newest part with `nextBefore` and
   `turnStart`. The reply aims for 4 MiB of encoded events; a second
   `before` request finishes the window.
2. **The prompt is in the window.** The reply contains the `input/message` of
   the input that started the turn, and of every input the first request
   consumed, even when those events precede `turn/start`. A queued input older
   than the newest message is included.
3. **Same fold.** For the whole-window replies of the 1,956- and 3,122-event
   Sessions, the returned sequences equal the forward paging of the same range,
   so the fold is today's. For the 6,862-event Session, the window and one
   `before` page cover the turn with no gap or overlap, and the union folds to
   the same state.
4. **Running turn.** With the turn still running, the window returns its input
   and `turn/start` through the pinned head; `done` is true when the window
   fits, and live `session.event` notifications after the pin still arrive.
5. **Older history.** After `done`, `before` pages reach the branch start and
   `done` becomes true; the existing forward read from `after: 0` returns the
   same events as before.
6. **No turn.** A branch with only appended inputs has no `turn/start`: the
   window is the branch's newest page and `turnStart` is absent.
7. **Compatibility.** A request without the new fields behaves as today, and a
   v3 client that does not read the new fields still folds pages.
   `hello.features` lists `session.history.latestTurn`.
8. **Index at open.** A v29 store opened by the new daemon contains
   `timeline_history_anchors`; dropping the index and reopening recreates it;
   reopening does not change the marker; `open_read_only` accepts a store with
   and without it. No row changes and no version bump.
9. **Byte bound.** A turn whose newest part encodes to more than 4 MiB is
   trimmed on batch boundaries, and its second page continues without a gap; a
   single batch above 4 MiB is returned whole, and only a batch above the
   transport frame replies `history_too_large`.
10. **Measurement.** A flow test builds turns of about 1,900, 3,100 and 6,900
    events and reports, for each, the number of `session.history` requests the
    client needs for the whole turn, the encoded reply bytes and the call
    latency; it asserts the request counts (1, 1, 2) and both bounds, and prints
    the byte and latency table in the PR.

## 12. Rejected alternatives

- **Return the whole turn regardless of size.** One reply must stay bounded; an
  unbounded turn would produce an unbounded reply (D4).
- **A window that starts at `turn/start`.** It loses the prompting input and
  every queued input the turn consumed, so a client cannot render the turn's
  user rows (D3).
- **A fixed number of events before `turn/start`.** A queued input's message can
  be arbitrarily older than the turn start; the window would sometimes include
  the wrong events and sometimes miss the input.
- **Expose only the turn start, e.g. `latestTurnStart` on attach.** The client
  would still page the turn from its start to the head, so the request count
  would grow with the turn, which is the measured problem.
- **A new method.** D1.
- **Opaque cursors.** D2.
- **Fix it in the client.** The boundary is server-side state; a client cache
  would duplicate it and still need the first read.
- **Stop materializing thinking deltas as separate events** (the issue's third
  option). That is a write-path and live-delivery change with its own
  durability rules ([#588](https://github.com/arcships/dim/issues/588)); it
  would reduce the turn's size but not bound it.

## 13. Changes to other documents

| Document | Change |
| --- | --- |
| [Documentation index](../../INDEX.md) | Add this design |
| [Native storage format](native-storage-format.md) | State that the derived index is created at open and is not part of the v29 schema gate |
| [Clients](../clients.md) | None now; a client document that describes opening a thread can link this window instead of forward paging |
| [sessions service](sessions-service.md), [session access](../contracts/session-access.md) | None (D8) |
