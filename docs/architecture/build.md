# Build environment

Run commands at the workspace root. `rust-toolchain.toml` pins Rust 1.98.1, rustfmt and Clippy. Do not copy target directories between worktrees.

```sh
rustup show
unset RUSTC_WRAPPER
export CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0
cargo build --workspace --locked
```

A normal Cargo installation is sufficient; compiler caching is optional. Each worktree keeps its own target directory. Existing source caches can be reused without sharing build outputs.

CI builds all workspace targets once, then checks the architecture and runs the recorded test executables two at a time with four test threads per executable. It sets `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to the checkout's `target` directory so a compiler cache's managed-target collection cannot remove binaries between the build and their later execution. Each executable keeps its Cargo package working directory and streams output immediately, with target start/end markers and exit status. A target has a ten-minute deadline (`DIM_TEST_TIMEOUT_MS` overrides it); timeout and cancellation terminate its process tree. Failures still allow the other targets to finish and fail the step. Cargo runs documentation tests separately with the same feature selection. Local `cargo test --workspace --locked` remains available without Node.

`xtask measure` records per-Session close samples immediately. After closing the Agent and its host, it allows up to 30 seconds for remaining Tokio tasks to settle; `cleanupSettleMs` reports that wait, and `tasksAfterAgentClose` and `allocationBytesAfterAgentClose` report the remaining tasks and Rust allocations. These final samples distinguish asynchronous disposal from retained state.

The root `./dev` entry performs incremental CLI/App Server builds without disabling Cargo incremental compilation and uses a separate development home. Use `./dev --model-config PATH` for an API-key flow; with the Dim account's client IDs set (`.env.dev`), `./dev` builds and runs the account build instead (see the [development contract](development.md)). Tests and full release packaging are explicit operations.

The [Web workspace](../design/web-workspace.md) frontend in `web/` is a separate artifact (`scripts/stage-web.mjs` builds it; the CLI finds the installed `dimcode-web` package or a `web/` directory beside the executable or in the product home, or `DIMCODE_WEB_ASSETS` names one), so building `dim-app-server` and `dimcode` needs neither Node nor npm. Only `cargo build --features embedded-web` compiles the frontend in; then `build.rs` runs `npm ci` and `npm run build` when that frontend changed, and a host without npm fails the build. Otherwise Node is only needed for packaging, packaging checks and TypeScript plugin execution/development. `.node-version` pins the Node version bundled into account-enabled releases. The `runtime/package-lock.json` fixes the rutis Node runtime and its transitive dependencies; `npm ci --ignore-scripts --prefix runtime` installs them for local bridge testing.

Full-workspace CI uses self-hosted macOS ARM64 runners; pull requests run only the check groups their paths need (see [GitHub workflows](../release/README.md#github-workflows)). A separate CLI job uses a self-hosted Windows x64 runner for its native boundary flows; its clipboard fixture writes the runner's current clipboard. Release builds use separate GitHub-hosted VMs matching each target OS and CPU. See the [runner setup and release matrix](../release/README.md#runner-setup).

Each runner's OS/libc baseline must be recorded and verified before declaring that platform supported. Cross-built executables are checked for the target architecture during staging, but installation and runtime acceptance still require the corresponding target system.

Public Node provider and MCP interoperability fixtures use development dependencies declared in `runtime/package.json`. Install them with `npm ci --prefix runtime --ignore-scripts`; distribution staging uses `--omit=dev` and does not ship those SDKs.

Evaluation-tool tests are opt-in: `cargo test --locked -p xtask --features eval-tests`. CI enables them for `xtask/` changes, main pushes and manual runs. The real 30-second background handoff is also opt-in locally: `cargo test --locked -p dim-agent-integration-tests --test local_execution a_long_foreground_command_moves_to_the_background_after_30_seconds -- --ignored --exact`; CI runs it for execution-related paths, main pushes and manual runs. Ordinary workspace tests retain execution cancellation, cleanup and recovery flows.

`npm run build --prefix web` type-checks and bundles the frontend. Run its component and projection flows separately with `npm test --prefix web`.
